Webots was originally designed at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch) in 1996 and then further developed and commercialized by [Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com) since 1998. In December 2018, Webots was open sourced. Since then, [Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com) continues to develop Webots thanks to paid customer support, training, consulting for industry and academic research projects.
