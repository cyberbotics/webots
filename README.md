### About us

Webots was originally designed at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch) in 1996 as a research tool for mobile robotics.
In 1998, it began being developed and commercialized by [Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com).
In December 2018, Webots was open sourced.
Since then, [Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com) continues to develop Webots thanks to paid customer support, training, and consulting for industry and academic research projects.

[Contact us](mailto:info@cyberbotics.com) to discuss your custom robot simulation projects and any additional comments, concerns, or developments you may have for our project!
