      Webots was originally designed at EPFL in 1996 as a research tool for mobile robotics. In 1998, it began being developed and commercialized by Cyberbotics. In December 2018, Webots was open sourced. Since then, Cyberbotics continues to develop Webots thanks to paid customer support, training, and consulting for industry and academic research projects.
