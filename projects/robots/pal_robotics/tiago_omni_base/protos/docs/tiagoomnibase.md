Designed by PAL Robotics, TIAGo OMNI Base is a mecanum omnidirectional robot.
The model is a modular mobile platform that automates deliveries in industrial environment.
It is completely ROS based and customizable with accessories to adapt to any specific need.

More information on the TIAGo OMNI Base robot can be found on their [website](http://pal-robotics.com/robots/tiago-base/) or in the [technical specifications datasheet](https://pal-robotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Datasheet-TIAGo-OMNI-Base.pdf).

### TiagoOmniBase PROTO

Derived from [Robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot).

```

  SFRotation   rotation         0 0 1 0
  SFString     name             "TIAGo OMNI Base"
  SFString     controller       "tiago_omni_base"
  MFString     controllerArgs   []
  SFString     window          "<generic>"
  SFString     customData       ""
  SFBool       supervisor       FALSE
  SFBool       synchronization  TRUE
  SFBool       selfCollision    FALSE

}
```

#### TiagoBase Field Summary

- `bodySlot`:  Extends the robot with new nodes (such as the `TiagoBody` for example).
- `lidarSlot`: Extends the robot with a front lidar sensor.
