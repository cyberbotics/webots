Designed by Mobile Industrial Robots, MiR100 is a six-wheeled robot: two of them, in the middle, are actuated, while the others are free caster wheels.
The model is a modular mobile platform used for logistics and indoor transport. It is well-suited for industries, as its design enables it to carry a payload of up to 100 kg.
It carries two [Lidars](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar) and four sonar [DistanceSensors](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#sonar-sensors) designed for obstacle avoidance, as well as a [RangeFinder](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder) at the front for navigation.
More information on the MiR100 robot can be found on the [constructor website](https://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/en/solutions/robots/mir100/).

#### MiR100 Field Summary

- `color`: Middle section color of the robot.
- `frontLidarSlot`: Extends the robot with a lidar on the front (such as the `SickS300` for example).
- `backLidarSlot`: Extends the robot with a lidar on the back (such as the `SickS300` for example).
- `bodySlot` : Extends the robot with new nodes (such as the `Robotino3Platform` for example).
