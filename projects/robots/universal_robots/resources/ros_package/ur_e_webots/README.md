## Usage

Once you have started a simulation with a UR robot and set its controller to `universal_robots_ros`, you can use the following launch file to setup all the required ROS parameters:

```
roslaunch ur_e_webots ur5e_joint_limited.launch
```

You can then control the robot with MoveIt!, use the following launch file (from the `universal_robot` ROS package) to start MoveIt!:

```
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch
```

For starting up RViz with a configuration including the MoveIt! Motion Planning plugin, run the following launch file (from the `universal_robot` ROS package):

```
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_rviz.lnch config:=true
```
