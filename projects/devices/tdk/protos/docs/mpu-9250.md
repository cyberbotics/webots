The [MPU-9250](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/9-axis/mpu-9250/) is a MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems) IMU device to track the orientation and motion of a body.
It is modeled as a solid chip embeding an [Accelerometer](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/accelerometer), a [Gyro](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gyro) and a [Compass](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass) to retrieve, respectively, acceleration values in [m/sÂ²], angular rates in [rad/s] and the vector indicating the north direction for heading.

Detailed specifications can be found [on this page](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PS-MPU-9250A-01-v1.1.pdf).
