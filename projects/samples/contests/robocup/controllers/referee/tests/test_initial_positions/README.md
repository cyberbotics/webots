On this test scenario, we have multiple valid and invalid positions for the
robots of both team:

- Team 1 (RED): 2 robots with invalid position
  - 1: entirely on the field
  - 2: partially on the border line
- Team 2 (BLUE): 2 robots have an invalid position
  - 2: partially on the back line
  - 4: on the wrong side

The following should happen:

1. All robots are spawned on their appropriate side, according to the team
   configuration files (except `Blue 4` who is on the wrong side).
2. During 2 minutes (real-time not simulated time), game state is `INITIAL` all
   robots stay static.
3. AutoRef sends a message to the GameController, status is changed to `READY`
4. Penalties are being called for illegaly positioned robots who are moved to
   appropriate locations.
5. Simulation is paused, `Red 1`, `Red 3` and `Blue 1` are manually moved inside
   the field, simulation is resumed.
6. Removal penalty and a yellow card is applied to `Red 1` (illegal entry).
7. Time elapses and game state changes to `SET`.
8. Robots `Red 4` and `Blue 3` are removed from the field by the auto-referee.
9. Time elapses and game state changes to `PLAY`.
10. Simulation is paused, `Red 1`, `Blue 2` and `Blue 3` are manually moved
    inside the field, simulation is resumed.
11. No robot is penalized.

The following information should be contained in logs (among others):
