/**
 * Defines interface for backpropagation network (backprop)
 * The network can be any size, but must be intialized before
 * using any of the functions. See xor_backprop.c for an example
 * of a backprop for the XOR problem.
 *
 * For most applications of the backprop, there will
 * be two programs: a training program and the application program.
 * The application program will only need to load the weight data,
 * input data to the network and retrieve the output.  For a training program,
 * the weights must be randomized, then trained with an appropriate
 * training set and the weights saved to an output file.
 *
 * When using creating a network with backprop.h, the first layer is implied.  Thus,
 * for a three-layer network, only two layers need to be defined.  In the case of
 * a three layer network, the hidden layer input serves also as the input layer.
 * See xor_backprop.h for an example of a simple three-layer network.
 *
 * The learning method used by the backprop is a gradient descent without
 * momentum.  For stable training used a learning rate close to 0 (e.g. 0.1 or 0.2),
 * for faster training use a learning rate close to 1 (e.g. 0.9 or 0.8).
 * Use caution when increasing the learning rate however because too large a rate
 * can cause the network never to converge on a set of weights.
 *
 * Note, there is no check performed on the data in the array, so if the pointers
 * are not referencing arrays of appropriate size, then memory errors will occur.
 * The sizes of the array which each pointer should reference are shown in the
 * layer_t definition.
