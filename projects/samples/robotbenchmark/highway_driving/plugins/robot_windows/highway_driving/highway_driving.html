      This benchmark aims at driving the farther as possible in one minute without colliding any other vehicles or static objects.

      The metric used to evaluate the vehicle controller is the distance traveled along the road after one minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the vehicle touches any other vehicles or static objects or it goes in the emergency lane, the simulation is stopped (even before one minute) and the already traveled distance is recorded.

      <h2>How to improve the performance?</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic controller is a simple program that makes the vehicle go straight and decrease its speed if another vehicle is detected in front in order to keep a security distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of decreasing the speed, the lateral <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor">DistanceSensor</a> devices can be used to check if it is possible to change lane in order to overtake (you are allowed to overtake by the right side).
      Here are the available <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor">DistanceSensor</a> devices:

    </p>
    <p>
      Note that after a while the road becomes curvy, you will therefore need to take the direction of the road into account.
      A simple way to do so is to use the lateral <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor">DistanceSensors</a> in order to know the distance to the right and left barriers.
      A more elegant way would be to use the <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera">Camera</a> in order to detect the road lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor">DistanceSensors</a>, the vehicle is equipped with a <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps">GPS</a> located in the center of the rear-wheels axes,
      and a frontal <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera">Camera</a> (with objects <a target=_blank href="https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition">Recognition</a> capability).
