              This benchmark aims at developing a program that controls a Pioneer robot to follow a wall.

              The robot has exactly 1 minute to go as far as possible, while trying to stay at a 50cm distance from the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
              The benchmark will first compute an "ideal" path.
              The first segment of this path is a direct line going from the starting position of the robot
              to the closest point which is 50cm away from the wall.
              The path then continues parallel to the wall, at a distance of exactly 50cm.
            </p>
            <p>
              The performance of your robot will be computed based on the average distance to this "ideal" path.
              Note that the robot is always facing the wall in its starting position,
              so the first part will always be to go forward until the wall is 50cm away.

            <p>
              Additionally, if the robot tries to take a shortcut, it will get a penalty for each skipped segment.
              At any given time, the segment of the path that is closest to the robot is considered as the current segment,
              and any segment prior to the current segment that has not been visited will be considered as skipped.

              <h2>How to improve the performance?</h2>
            </p>
            <p>
              The controller (in Python) is based on the value received by the sonar sensors of the robot.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic controller is extremely simplistic and only uses 2 of the sensors available on the robot. Because
              of this, and because of how sonar sensors work (see below), it is very bad at handling sharp turns, and will
              basically only work as long as the wall is almost straight.
            </p>
            <p>
              A first simple improvement would be to consider the orientation of the robot with respect to the wall,
              for example if you are too far from the wall, but the robot is already heading towards the wall,
              you don't need to turn any further. In order to do this you can use the
              fact that the robot has 2 sensors on each side, and use the difference between the two to estimate the orientation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a second time, you need to consider the values of the front sensors, otherwise the robot won't be able to detect a sharper
              angle in the wall, and will most likely bump into it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It could also be useful to detect when the robot has hit the wall, and make the robot go backward when it happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The sensors of the Pioneer 3-DX have the following configuration:
            </p>
            <div style='text-align:center'><img src="pioneer3at_sonars.png"></div>
            <p>
              There is an angle of 20째 between adjacent sensors, except for the side sensors (so0, so7, so8 and so15),
              which have a 40째 angle. The maximum range of the sensors is 5m.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the sensors of the Pioneer 3-DX are sonars, they can only detect an obstacle within their angle of incidence,
              which is 22.5째 in this case. In other words, sonar rays which lie outside the reflexion cone of aperture 45째 are not
              picked up by the sonar which causes the obstacle to be "invisible" to this particular sensor.
