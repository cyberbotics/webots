      This benchmark aims at developing a program that controls a BB-8 robot to escape from a pit.

    <p>
      The robot has to get out of the pit as fast as possible.
      The benchmark stops if the robot takes more than one minute to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the robot is able to get out of the pit, the metric will be based on how fast the robot was to get out.
      Otherwise, the metric will measure how close it was from escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first case the metric ranges from 50% to 100% and is linearly correlated with the time result.
      A value of 100% is awarded for an instantaneous escape, while a value of 50% is awarded for a last-second escape.
      In the second case the metric ranges from 0% to 50% and is linearly correlated with the distance from the top of the pit.

      <h2>How to improve the performance?</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      The slope is too steep for the robot to simply go forward.
      Instead, it should go back and forth to accumulate momentum until it has enough to climb out of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic controller simply goes back and forth at regular time intervals.
      You should try to find a better way to decide when to change direction to optimize the accumulated momentum.
      For example you can use the gyro sensor of the robot to measure the current velocity of the robot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gyro can be initialized using the following piece of code:
    </p>
    <code>gyro = robot.getGyro("body gyro")</code><br>
    <code>gyro.enable(timestep)</code>
    <p>
      You can then use
    </p>
    <code>gyro.getValues()</code>
    <p>
      to read the current value of the sensor.
