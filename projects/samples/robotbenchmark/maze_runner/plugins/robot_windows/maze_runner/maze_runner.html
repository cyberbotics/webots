          <p>The benchmark metric <em>t</em> is the time taken by the robot to reach the center of the maze depicted with the "BASE" text.
             The goal is to complete the task as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>The timer stops after either the robot is in the center of the maze or more than 1 minute has elapsed.</p>
          <p>Any collision with the maze walls is considered an immediate failure to complete the task, and a time of 1 minute (the maximum time) is recorded.</p>

          <h2>How to improve your time?</h2>
            <p>The Thymio II in the default controller reads values from its frontal distance sensors, and uses only two of them to move forward or rotate.
               This is a very naive approach: it is not possible to adjust the robot's orientation, nor will the robot avoid bumping into the maze walls.
            </p>
            <p>Using more sensor values you can have a more precise control on the distance between the robot and the maze walls
               in order to reach the center of the maze without touching them.
               This can for example be achieved by applying the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Braitenberg Vehicle</a> approach.

          <p>This experiment can be easily reproduced for a real Thymio II robot.
             The size of the paper on which the maze is drawn is 1.06mx0.81m and you can use some light bricks to build the walls.
             The position of the walls is depicted with solid black lines.
