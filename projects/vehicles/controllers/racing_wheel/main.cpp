 * Description:   This controller should be used to control a car using a real racing wheel
 *                It has been tested with the 'Logitech G27 and G29 Racing Wheel'. However,
 *                it should work with any joystick/racing wheel (if an appropriate custom
 *                configuration file is assed in argument, or the default one is adapted).
