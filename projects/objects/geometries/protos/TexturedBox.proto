# keywords: primitive/geometry
# Box with customizable texture mapping.
# Available texture mappings:
# - `cube` mapping: see texture at projects/samples/geometries/worlds/textures/cube_mapping.jpg
# - `compact` cube mapping: see texture at projects/samples/geometries/worlds/textures/compact_mapping.jpg
# - `flat` mapping: projecting the texture on the front face
# - `metric` mapping: similar to default mapping but the texture is not deformed to match each face size
# - `default` mapping: same texture on all the faces
# - `none`: no texture mapping
# If a boolean field (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) is FALSE, then the corresponding face is not drawn.
# A demo of these mappings is available in projects/samples/geometries/worlds/textured_boxes.wbt.
