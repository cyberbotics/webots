## Adept's Pioneer 3-DX

%robot pioneer-3dx images/robots/pioneer-3dx/model.thumbnail.png

The Pioneer 3-DX robot is an all-purpose base, used for research and applications involving mapping, teleoperation, localization, monitoring, reconnaissance and other behaviors.
Pioneer 3-DX is characterized by a set of features listed in [this table](#pioneer-3-dx-characteristics).

The base Pioneer 3-DX platform is assembled with motors featuring 500-tick encoders, 19 cm wheels, tough aluminum body, 8 forward-facing ultrasonic (sonar) sensors, 8 optional rear-facing sonars, 1, 2 or 3 hot-swappable batteries, and a complete software development kit.
The base Pioneer 3-DX platform can reach speeds of 1.6 meters per second and carry a payload of up to 23 kg.

More information on specifications and optional devices are available on the following links as the official Adept Mobile Robots website no longer exists: [Operations manual (2007, v.5)](http://vigir.missouri.edu/~gdesouza/Research/MobileRobotics/Software/P3OpMan5.pdf) and [technical data](https://www.generationrobots.com/media/Pioneer3DX-P3DX-RevA.pdf).

This model includes support for two motors, the caster wheel, 7 [LEDs](../reference/led.md) on the control panel and 16 sonar sensors (8 forward-facing, 8 rear-facing) for proximity measurements.
The standard model of the Pioneer 3-DX is provided in the "pioneer3dx.wbt" file which is located in the "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/adept/pioneer3/worlds" directory of the Webots distribution.

The Pioneer 3-DX motors are [RotationalMotor](../reference/rotationalmotor.md) nodes named according to [this figure](#pioneer-3-dx-motor-names).
The `wb_set_motor_position` and `wb_set_motor_velocity` functions allow the user to control the rotation of the wheels.

The angle between two consecutive sensor directions is 20 degrees except for the four side sensors (so0, so7, so8 and so15) for which the angle is 40 degrees.

The 7 [LEDs](../reference/led.md) are named according to [this table](#pioneer-3-dx-led-names), where the numbers are shown on [this figure](#leds-positions).

### Samples

Here are listed the different example worlds based on the Pioneer 3-DX.
The worlds and controllers can be accessed in the "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/adept/pioneer3" directory.

#### pioneer3dx.wbt

![pioneer3dx_example.png](images/robots/pioneer-3dx/pioneer3dx.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) The "pioneer3dx.wbt" world file shows a simulation example of an avoidance algorithm based on the use of the 16 sonar sensors (see the "pioneer3dx\_collision\_avoidance.c" controller file).
The three [LEDs](../reference/led.md) are switched on and off periodically.

#### pioneer3dx\_collision\_avoidance.wbt

![pioneer3dx_collision_avoidance.png](images/robots/pioneer-3dx/pioneer3dx_collision_avoidance.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) The "pioneer3dx\_collision\_avoidance.wbt" world file is a simulation example of an avoidance algorithm based on the use of the 16 sonar sensors in a dark environment (see the "pioneer3dx\_obstacle\_avoidance.c" controller file).

#### pioneer3dx\_gripper.wbt

![pioneer3dx_gripper.png](images/robots/pioneer-3dx/pioneer3dx_gripper.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) The "pioneer3dx_gripper.wbt" world file is a simulation example where a gripper is used to move a ball (see the "pioneer3dx\_gripper.c" controller file).
The `Pioneer3Gripper` PROTO is mounted on the `extensionSlot` of the `Pioneer3dx` PROTO node.

#### pioneer3dx\_matlab.wbt

![pioneer3dx_matlab.png](images/robots/pioneer-3dx/pioneer3dx_matlab.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) The "pioneer3dx_matlab.wbt" world file is a simulation example an obstacle avoidance behavior using a MATLAB controller (see the "pioneer3dx\_matlab.m" controller file).

#### pioneer3dx\_with\_kinect.wbt

![pioneer3dx_with_kinect.png](images/robots/pioneer-3dx/pioneer3dx_with_kinect.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) The "pioneer3dx\_with\_kinect.wbt" world file is a simple simulation example of an obstacle avoidance behavior based on a Microsoft Kinect sensor (see the "pioneer3dx\_obstacle\_avoidance\_kinect.c" controller file).
The `Kinect` PROTO is mounted in the `extensionSlot` field of the `Pioneer3dx` PROTO node.
