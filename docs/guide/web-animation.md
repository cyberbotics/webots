## Web Animation

### Description

Webots can record a simulation to an interactive 3D `HTML` page.
The result is similar to a movie with playback controls, except that you can change the viewpoint at any time.

The mechanism is similar to the [web scene export](web-scene.md), except that a supplementary `JSON` animation file containing the moving objects positions is exported.

The [figure below](#screenshot-of-a-web-animation-page-generated-by-webots) shows an example of an animation page generated by Webots. This animation is available [here](https://cyberbotics.com/animations/soccer_example/soccer.html).

### How to Export a Web Animation

Select the `Share...` menu item and choose if you want to upload it to [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud) or to save it locally, then click the `Record and export animation` button to start the recording.
Click the `Stop HTML5 animation` to finish the recording and save the animation.
Webots will ask to playback the resulting file in the default Web browser (from the OS settings).

**Note**: The `CSS` file, the `X3D` file, the `JSON` animation file and the required textures are exported in the same directory as the target `HTML` file.

**Note**: The `CSS` file is meant to be used as a styling guide but can be modified/removed.

**Note**: The playback option may not work correctly depending on your default Web browser.
In this case, please refer to the [section below](#remarks-on-the-used-technologies-and-their-limitations).

**Note**: A [Supervisor](supervisor-programming.md) can start or stop an animation recording as well.

### How to Embed a Web Animation in Your Website

Please refer to [this section](web-scene.md#how-to-embed-a-web-scene-in-your-website).

### Programming Interface

The web animation is played by a web component from the [WebotsView.js] package called `webots-view`.

The following attributes are available:
* `data-thumbnail`: the name of the .jpg file containing the thumbnail. If the `data-thumbnail` attribute is not set, a default thumbnail will be displayed during load.
* `data-scene`: the name of the .x3d file containing the 3d scene.
* `data-animation`: the name of the .json file containing the animation sequence.
* `data-autoplay`: boolean to determine if the animation should be played automatically, `true` by default.
* `data-isMobileDevice`: boolean variable specifying if the application is running on a mobile device.

The attributes of `webots-view` are only evaluated once: when the page is loaded. If the `data-scene` and the `data-animation` attributes are set, the `webots-view` web-component will automatically try to load an animation .

For more complex interaction with the web component, the following functions are available:
* `close()`: close the current animation. Note that if the `webots-view` element is removed from the HTML page or `loadScene`, `loadAnimation` or `connect` is called, `close` will be automatically called.
* `getNode(id)`: return the webotsjs node with the corresponding `id` if it exists or undefined.
  * `id`: the id of the node to get.
* `hasAnimation()`: return `true` if there is already a animation loaded by the web component, `false` otherwise.
* `hasView()`: return `true` if a view exist, `false` otherwise.
* `loadAnimation(scene, animation, play, mobileDevice)`: load and play the animation.
  * `scene`: name of the .x3d file.
  * `animation`: name of the .json file.
  * `play`: if false, the animation will be paused, otherwise it will be played.
  * `mobileDevice`: boolean variable specifying if the application is running on a mobile device.
* `onready()`: a function that can be overridden. It will be called once the animation is loaded.
* `resize()`: automatically resize the web-component.
* `setAmbientOcclusion(level)`: change the intensity of the ambient occlusion to the given level.
    * `level`: the new level of ambient occlusion. Integer between 1 and 4.
* `updateNode(nodeId, field, value, render)`: Update the value of a webotsjs node. The value is updated only on the web side, do not use with the simulation.
  * `nodeId`: the id of the node (for example: 113).
  * `field`: the field to update. Supported field are: `translation`, `rotation`, `scale` and the various `colors`.
  * `value`: the new value to be set, in `WbVector3.js` or `WbVector4.js` format.
  * `render`: a boolean that indicates whether the function should render once or not once the modifications are applied.

### Limitations

The animation file contains only modifications over the following fields:
- `LED.color`
- `Material.diffuseColor`
- `Material.emissiveColor`
- `TextureTransform.translation` (only for the [Track](../reference/track.md) node)
- `Transform.rotation`
- `Transform.translation`
- `Light.color`
- `Light.on`

The other fields are not recorded in the animation file.
Node insertion or deletion are also not recorded in the animation file.

Additional limitations are described in [this section](web-scene.md#limitations).

### Scene Refresh Rate

The scene refresh rate is defined by the `window.requestAnimationFrame()` function. The number of refresh is generally 60 per seconds but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers according to the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame).

However, the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` field have an impact on the refresh rate too, because the updates are only sent during the simulation step.
The actual refresh rate can be computed with the following formula:

> **Note**: It is not recommended to change the `WorldInfo.FPS` or `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` fields while recording an animation.
