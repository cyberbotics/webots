%robot tiago-steel images/robots/tiago_steel/model.thumbnail.png

Designed by PAL Robotics, TIAGo Steel is a two-wheeled human-like robot with a torso, a head and one articulated arm finished by a parallel gripper as end-effector.
It is completely ROS based, fully customizable and expandable with extra sensors and devices like other end-effector (Hey5 hand).

More information on the TIAGo Steel robot can be found on their [website](http://pal-robotics.com/robots/tiago/) or in the [technical specifications datasheet](http://pal-robotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Datasheet_TIAGo_Complete.pdf).
