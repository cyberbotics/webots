The "GhostDog" robot is a dog-like robot developed by the [EPFL BioRob laboratory](https://biorob.epfl.ch/).

It is a quadruped robot made of active hip joints and passive knee joints (using springs and dampers).
Each knee is made of two embedded HingeJoint nodes, one active and one passive, sharing the same rotation axis.
The passive HingeJoint simulates the spring and damping.
The active HingeJoint is not actuated in the following demo but it could be used for controlling the knee joints.

#### ghostdog.wbt

![ghostdog.png](images/robots/ghostdog/ghostdog.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) This example shows the GhostDog robot which gallops.
The keyboard can be used to control the robot's direction and to change the amplitude of the galloping motion.
