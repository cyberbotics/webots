## MATLAB

The *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup> API for Webots is very similar to the C API.
The functions names are identical, only the type and number of parameters differs slightly in some cases.
The MATLAB functions and prototypes are described in Webots [Reference Manual](../reference/index.md).
Note that unlike with the C API, there are no `wb_robot_init` and `wb_robot_cleanup` functions in the MATLAB API.
The necessary initialization and cleanup are automatically carried out respectively before entering and after leaving the controller code.

If the MATLAB code uses graphics, it is necessary to call the `drawnow` command somewhere in the control loop in order to flush the graphics.

Here is a simple MATLAB controller example:

```MATLAB
% uncomment the next two lines to use the MATLAB desktop
%desktop;
%keyboard;

TIME_STEP = 32;

my_led = wb_robot_get_device('my_led');
my_sensor = wb_robot_get_device('my_sensor');

wb_distance_sensor_enable(my_sensor, TIME_STEP);

while wb_robot_step(TIME_STEP) ~= -1
  % read the sensors
  val = wb_distance_sensor_get_value(my_sensor);

  % Process sensor data here

  % send actuator commands
  wb_led_set(my_led, 1);

  % uncomment the next line if there's graphics to flush
  % drawnow;
end
```

### Using the MATLAB Desktop

In order to avoid cluttering the desktop with too many windows, Webots starts MATLAB with the *-nodesktop* option.
The *-nodesktop* option starts MATLAB without user interface and therefore it keeps the memory usage low which is useful in particular for multi-robot experiments.
If you would like to use the MATLAB desktop to interact with your controller you just need to add these two MATLAB commands somewhere at the beginning of your controller m-file:

```MATLAB
desktop;
keyboard;
```

The `desktop` command brings up the MATLAB desktop.
The `keyboard` stops the execution of the controller and gives control to the keyboard (`K>>` prompt).
Then MATLAB opens your controller m-file in its editor and indicates that the execution is stopped at the `keyboard` command.
After that, the controller m-file can be debugged interactively, i.e., it is possible to continue the execution step-by-step, set break points, watch variable, etc.
While debugging, the current values of the controller variables are shown in the MATLAB workspace.
It is possible to *continue* the execution of the controller by typing `return` at the `K>>` prompt.
Finally the execution of the controller can be terminated with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> key combination.

Once the controller is terminated, the connection with Webots remains active.
Therefore it becomes possible to issue Webots commands directly on the MATLAB prompt, for example you can interactively issue commands to query the sensors, etc.:

```MATLAB
>> wb_robot_step(1000);
>> wb_gps_get_values(gps)

ans =

    0.0001    0.0030   -0.6425
>> |
```

It is possible to use additional `keyboard` statements in various places in your ".m" controller.
So each time MATLAB will run into a `keyboard` statement, it will return control to the `K>>` prompt where you will be able to debug interactively.

At this point, it is also possible to restart the controller by calling its m-file from MATLAB prompt.
Note that this will restart the controller only, not the whole simulation, so the current robot and motor positions will be preserved.
If you want to restart the whole simulation you need to use the `Reload` button as usual.
