## Adept's Pioneer 3-AT

%robot pioneer-3at images/robots/pioneer-3at/model.thumbnail.png

The Pioneer 3-AT robot is an all-purpose outdoor base, used for research and prototyping applications involving mapping, navigation, monitoring, reconnaissance and other behaviors.
It is caracterized by a set of features listed in [this table](#pioneer-3-at-characteristics).
This model includes support for 4 motors and 16 sonar sensors (8 forward-facing, 8 rear-facing) for proximity measurements.

More information on specifications and optional devices are available on the following links as the official Adept Mobile Robots website no longer exists: [Operations manual (2007, v.5)](http://vigir.missouri.edu/~gdesouza/Research/MobileRobotics/Software/P3OpMan5.pdf) and [technical data](https://www.generationrobots.com/media/Pioneer3AT-P3AT-RevA-datasheet.pdf).

The standard model of the Pioneer 3-AT is provided in the "pioneer3AT.wbt" file which is located in the "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/adept/pioneer3/worlds" directory of the Webots distribution.

The Pioneer 3-AT motors are [RotationalMotor](../reference/rotationalmotor.md) nodes named according to [this figure](#pioneer-3-at-motor-names).
The `wb_set_motor_position` and `wb_set_motor_velocity` functions allow the user to control the rotation of the wheels.

The angle between two consecutive sensor directions is 20 degrees except for the four side sensors (so0, so7, so8 and so15) for which the angle is 40 degrees.

### Samples

#### pioneer3at.wbt

![pioneer3at_avoidance.png](images/robots/pioneer-3at/pioneer3at_avoidance.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) The "pioneer3at.wbt" world file is a simulation example of a simple obstacle avoidance behavior based on the use of a SICK LMS 291 [Lidar](../reference/lidar.md) (see the "obstacle\_avoidance\_with\_lidar.c" controller file in the "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/adept/pioneer3/controller" directory).
The [Lidar](../reference/lidar.md) depth output is used to compute two stimuli in front of the robot.
These two stimuli are computed by a [Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function) applied slightly on the front left, and respectively on the front right of the robot.
