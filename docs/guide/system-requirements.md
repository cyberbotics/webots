## System Requirements

The following hardware is required to run Webots:

- A fairly recent PC or Mac computer with at least a 2 GHz dual core CPU clock speed and 2 GB of RAM is a minimum requirement.
A quad-core CPU is however recommended.
- An NVIDIA or AMD OpenGL (minimum version 3.3) capable graphics adapter with at least 512 MB of RAM is required.
We do not recommend any other graphics adapters, including Intel graphics adapters, as they often lack a good OpenGL support which may cause 3D rendering problems and application crashes.
Nevertheless, in some cases, the installation of the latest Intel graphics driver can fix such problems and let you use Webots.
However, we don't provide any guarantee on this.
For Linux systems, we recommend only NVIDIA graphics cards.
Webots works well on all the graphics cards included in fairly recent Apple computers.

The following operating systems are supported:

- Linux: Webots is ensured to run on the latest Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) release, currently version 20.04.
But it is also known to run on most recent major Linux distributions, including RedHat, Mandrake, Debian, Gentoo, Arch, SuSE, and Slackware.
We recommend using a recent version of Linux.
Webots is provided for Linux 64 (x86-64) systems.
Webots doesn't run on Ubuntu versions earlier than 16.04, but only packages for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 are provided.
To run Webots on Ubuntu 16.04, please compile Webots from sources following [these instructions](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation).
- Windows: Webots runs on Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 (64-bit versions only).
- Mac: Webots runs on macOS 10.15 "Catalina" and 10.14 "Mojave".

Webots may work but is not officially supported on earlier versions of the above mentioned operating systems.

Other versions of Webots for other UNIX systems may be available upon request.
