## Controller Plugin

The controller functionality can be extended with user-implemented plugins.
The purpose of a controller plugin is to ease the programming of robot-specific robot windows and remote-control wrappers.

Programming controller plugins rather than programming directly in the controller is more convenient because it increases considerably the modularity and the scalability of the code.
For example a robot window can be used for several robots.

### Fundamentals

Whatever its language, a controller executable is linked with the Webots controller library (libController) at startup.
A controller plugin is a shared library loaded dynamically (at runtime) by libController after a specific event depending on its type.

The following [figure](#controller-plugin-overview) shows an overview of the controller plugin system.
In this figure, the dashed arrows shows how the shared libraries are loaded, and the large dash lines represents an Inter-Process Communication (IPC).
The IPC between libController and Webots is a pipe (On Windows this is a named pipe, and otherwise a local domain socket).
The IPC between libRemoteControl and the real robot is defined by the user (TCP/IP, Serial, etc.).

The system has been designed as follows.
All the entities (the controller, the remote control library and the robot window library) should only call the libController interface (Webots API) functions.
The controller should not be aware of its robot window and its real robot for modularity reasons.
The only exception is about the robot window library which can be aware of the remote control library in order to initialize and monitor it.
This can be done via the libController API through the `wb_robot_get_mode`, `wb_robot_set_mode` and the `wb_remote_control_custom_function` functions.
Of course these rules can be easily broken because every entity runs into the same process.
However, we recommend to respect them to get a good design.

The controller plugins have been designed to be written in C/C++, because the result should be a dynamic library.
However, it's certainly possible to write them in other languages using a C/C++ wrapper inbetween.

After its loading, some controller plugin functions (entry points) are called by libController.
A set of entry points have to be defined to let the controller plugin work smoothly.
Some of these entry points are required and some are optional.

The [Robot](../reference/robot.md) node defines the location of the controller plugin through its *window* and its *remoteControl* fields.

The controller plugin runs in the main thread of the process (also known as GUI thread): the same as the controller executable.
This implies that if an entry point of a plugin is blocked, the controller will also be blocked.
And if the plugin crashes, the controller is also crashed.

The search algorithm to convert the *window* and the *remoteControl* to an existing path is explained in the [Reference Manual](../reference/robot.md).

Each distributed shared library is built thanks to the main Makefile (the same as the one used to build the controllers):

`WEBOTS_HOME/resources/Makefile.include`

    libController -->|0..1| libRemoteControl[libRemoteControl]
  end

%end
%end

### Robot Window

A robot window allows the programmer to efficiently create custom user interfaces for its robots.
Robot windows can be opened by using the [context menu](the-3d-window.md#context-menu).
The *window* field of the [Robot](../reference/robot.md) node specifies the robot window.

Robot windows are implemented in HTML and provide the following features:

1. They rely on HTML layout and JavaScript programming.
2. They communicate directly with the robot controller using two JavaScript functions: `window.robotWindow.receive` and `window.robotWindow.send`.
The equivalent controller functions are `wb_robot_wwi_receive_text` and `wb_robot_wwi_send_text`. 
3. They are web-ready, hence they use a web browser to display robot windows.

A simple example of an HTML robot window is given in [`projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window_simple`](samples-howto.md#custom_robot_window_simple-wbt).
It demonstrates how to establish a two-way communication between a robot window and a Python controller.

To create a similar robot window for your project follow these steps:
1. In your project's root create a file in the following path `plugins/robot_windows/<robot window name>/<robot window name>.html`.
2. The file is a typical HTML document that can contain JavaScript and CSS.
However, in addition to the standard JavaScript library, a `robotWindow` object has to be imported.
It exposes an interface to allow communication with a robot controller.
You can check usage examples of `window.robotWindow.receive` and `window.robotWindow.send` in [`projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window_simple/plugins/robot_windows/custom_robot_window_simple/custom_robot_window_simple.html`]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window_simple/plugins/robot_windows/custom_robot_window_simple/custom_robot_window_simple.html).
3. The robot window needs to be registered in the robot's node.
Find your robot in the scene tree, select a `window` field, click select and choose `<robot window name>`.
4. To send and receive data inside the controller you have to use `wb_robot_wwi_receive_text` and `wb_robot_wwi_send_text`.
A very simple Python example is given in [`projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window_simple/controllers/custom_robot_window_simple/custom_robot_window_simple.py`]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window_simple/controllers/custom_robot_window_simple/custom_robot_window_simple.py).

An example of a reusable HTML robot window is given in [`projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window`](samples-howto.md#custom_robot_window-wbt).
While in the previous example the HTML robot window interacts directly with the controller, in this example the robot window exchanges data with a controller implemented in [`plugins/robot_windows/custom_robot_window/custom_robot_window.c`]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects/samples/howto/custom_robot_window/plugins/robot_windows/custom_robot_window/custom_robot_window.c).
Therefore, the robot window in this case can be reused in different simulations.

<br />

The HTML robot windows can communicate with controller programs written using any of the supported programming languages, i.e. C, C++, Python, Java, MATLAB and ROS.
If a [Robot](../reference/robot.md)'s controller is changed or restarted during the simulation run, the robot window associated to the same [Robot](../reference/robot.md) node will be restarted as well.

### Remote-Control Plugin

A remote-control plugin allows to simply and efficiently create an interface using the Webots API to communicate with a real robot.
The main purpose of a remote-control library is to wrap all the Webots API functions used by the robot with a protocol communicating to the real robot.
Generally, a program (client) runs on the real robot, and decodes the communication protocol to dialog with the real robot devices.

The remote-control library is initialized when an entity calls the `wb_robot_set_mode` libController function.
This entity is typically libRobotWindow, because it's quite convenient to use the GUI to initialize the communication (i.e. entering the IP address of the robot, etc.).

There are two entry points to the remote-control library:

- `bool wbr_init(WbrInterface *ri)`

    This function is called by libController to initialize the remote control
    library. It is called after the first `wb_robot_set_mode` function call. The goal of
    this function is to map the functions given into the `WbrInterface` structure
    with functions inside the remote-control library.

- `void wbr_cleanup()`

    This function is called by libController to cleanup the library.

The `WbrInterface` structure has several functions (mandatory) which have to be mapped to let the remote-control library run smoothly.
Here they are:

- `bool wbr_start(const char *args)`

    This function is called when the connection with the real robot should start (i.e. when [`wb_robot_set_mode(WB_MODE_REMOTE_CONTROL, ...)`](../reference/robot.md#wb_robot_set_mode) is called from the controller).
    The return value of this function should inform if the connection has been a
    success or not. The argument matches with the argument given to
    the `wb_robot_set_mode` function when initializing the remote-control. As the robot window
    library is often responsible for calling the `wb_robot_set_mode` function, the structure
    passed between them should match.

- `void wbr_stop()`

    This function is called when the connection with the real robot should stop.
    Typically a command stopping the real robot actuators should be sent just before
    stopping the connection.

- `bool wbr_has_failed()`

    This function is called very often by libController to check the validity of the
    connection. The value returned by this function should always match with the
    connection validity.

- `void wbr_stop_actuators()`

    This function is called to stop the actuators of the real robot. This is called
    when the user pressed the pause button of the simulator.

- `int wbr_robot_step(int period)`

    This function is called when the controller enters in the step loop. The aim of
    this function is to send the actuator commands and then to read the vaues of the
    enabled sensors. The timing problem should be solved there. The robot should
    wait at least *period* milliseconds, and return the delta time if this *period*
    is exceeded.

As mentioned above, all the Webots API functionalities that should work with the real robot have to be wrapped into the remote-control library.
To achieve this:

- The internal state of the libController has to be setup to match with the current state of the robot.

    Typically, when the value of a sensor is known the corresponding
    `wbr_sensor_set_value` function has to be called.

- The commands sent to the libController have to be wrapped.

    Typically, when the command of an actuator is setup the corresponding
    `wbr_actuator_set_value)` function is called, and has to be sent to the real robot.

The complete definition of the remote control API and of the `WbrInterface` structure is contained in the following file:

`WEBOTS_HOME/include/controller/c/webots/remote_control.h`

For example, if you want to be able to use the distance sensor of the real robot, you have to wrap the `wbr_set_sampling_period` function (to set the internal state of the remote control library to read this distance sensor only when required), and to call the `wbr_distance_sensor_set_value` function into the remote-control library when the distance sensor is refreshed (typically into the `wbr_robot_step` function).

A complete sample (communicating with the e-puck robot using bluetooth) can be found in this directory:
