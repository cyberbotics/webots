# Road

## Road PROTO

A fully customizable road, the number of lanes, the dimensions and the path of the road is configurable.
For each line separating two lanes it is possible to configure if this one is continuous or dashed.
B-Spline can be used in order to interpolate the path of the road and an optional border can be enable.
The boundingObject of each border and the road itself can be independently enable or disable.
This model was sponsored by the CTI project RO2IVSim ([http://transport.epfl.ch/simulator-for-mobile-robots-and-intelligent-vehicles](http://transport.epfl.ch/simulator-for-mobile-robots-and-intelligent-vehicles)).

## LaneSeparation

A simple segment of road allowing to divide a road into two smaller ones (or to assemble two roads into a bigger one).
The number of lanes of each of the two smaller roads is independently configurable as well as a lot of others parameters of a regular road.
