### Is Webots Really Free and Open-Source?

Since the [R2019a version](../blog/Webots-2019-a-release.md), Webots is completely free and open-source.
It remains under active development.
The source code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots) and released under the terms of the [Apache 2 license]({{ url.github_tree }}/LICENSE).

But please, upgrade Webots ;-) !
