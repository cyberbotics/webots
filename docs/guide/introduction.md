## Introduction

Webots can execute controllers written in compiled (C/C++, Java) or interpreted (Python, MATLAB) languages.
The compilation or interpretation process requires extra software that must usually be installed separately.
It is not necessary to install a separate C/C++ compiler only when using C/C++ on the Windows platform ; on this platform Webots comes with a pre-installed and preconfigured copy of the MinGW C/C++ compiler.
For any other language or platform the software development tools must be installed separately.
Note that Webots uses very standard tools that may already be present in a standard installation.
Otherwise the instructions in this chapter will advise you about the installation of your software development tools.
