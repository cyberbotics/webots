## Pre-requisites for the users

This page is for those users who want to explore this feild of robotics through webots, but their basic knowledge regarding 

robots might not be up to the mark .

The Prerequisites are as follows:

1. Some Mathematical topics such as : Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability & Statistics as well as combinatorics .
{ A university level mathematics course should be taken so as to get thorough with these parts}

2. Knowledge of any/all programming language(s) out of the following upto intermediate level is desired : C++, Python, Java , Matlab
as well as stronghold on basic coding algorithms.

3. Basic knowledge of circuits and circuit components.

Over here we have provided links to various research papers/ books/ online courses/ regarding each pre-requisite:
1. **Mathematical courses**

a) **[Course 16-811: Math fundamentals for robotics]**(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~me/811/notes/handouts.html) is one of the best courses.

b)**[Fundamental Mathematical Concepts for Problems Arising in Robotics (PDF)]**(http://othes.univie.ac.at/27778/1/2013-04-15_0203586.pdf)
This PDF can be used for further references, if needed.

2. ** Programming Languages **

a) For c++ :- **[The C++ Programming Language (Second Edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup]**(https://www.stroustrup.com/2nd.html) is one of the best books
available out there for learning C++.
