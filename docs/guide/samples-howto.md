In this example, the `wb_motor_set_force` function is used to simulate the effect of a spring and a damper between the two boxes.
When the simulation starts, the motor force is used to move the boxes apart.
Then, the motor force is turned off and the boxes oscillate for a while, according to the spring and damping equations programmed in the controller.
In addition, there is an equivalent version of a MATLAB controller `force_control_matlab` that you can switch to.

Each P-controller is tested during a period of 400 time steps, i.e. 12.8 seconds.
A P-controller 'succeeds' if a constant error amplitude repeats at least 10 times during the test period.
Otherwise the proportional gain P is incremented by 10 and the experiment restarts.
The tuned Ziegler-Nichols "ultimate" gains will be computed for the first successful controller.
The result is plot in a [Display](../reference/display.md) overlay.
