**Keywords**: Force control, linear motor, spring and damper

![force_control.png](images/samples/force_control.thumbnail.jpg) This world shows two boxes connected by a [LinearMotor](../reference/linearmotor.md).
Here, the purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the `wb_motor_set_force` function to control a [LinearMotor](../reference/linearmotor.md) with a user specified force.
In this example, the `wb_motor_set_force` function is used to simulate the effect of a spring and a damper between the two boxes.
When the simulation starts, the motor force is used to move the boxes apart.
Then, the motor force is turned off and the boxes oscillate for a while, according to the spring and damping equations programmed in the controller.
In addition, there is an equivalent version of a MATLAB controller `force_control_matlab` that you can switch to.

**Keywords**: four-wheeled frame

![four_wheels.png](images/samples/four_wheels.thumbnail.jpg) This example shows three models of four-wheeled vehicles.
In the first layout, the four motorized wheels are positioned circularly, as could be done for omnidirectional-wheeled robots.
In the second layout, the four motorized wheels are oriented in the same direction, as could be done for a robot with tracks.
In the third layout, a simple [Ackermann steering geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometry) is shown.
Note that more completed Ackermann steering geometry can be achieved using the [AckermannVehicle](https://webots.cloud/run?url={{ url.github_tree }}/projects/vehicles/protos/abstract/AckermannVehicle.proto) PROTO, and the [`car` library](../automobile/car-library.md).

**Keywords**: gears, self-collision

![gears.png](images/samples/gears.thumbnail.jpg) This example shows the transfer of power between two gears through physical interaction.
The red gear is motorized whereas the blue one is passive, and when the `boundingObject` at the tip of the teeth collides the second wheel begins to turn.
Using this sort of approach as general purpose transmission is not generally advised but does work with some tuning of the `dampingConstant` of the [HingeJoint](../reference/hingejoint.md), and the `ERP` and `CFM` values in the [WorldInfo](../reference/worldinfo.md) node.

**Keywords**: Mouse events, user input

![mouse_events.png](images/samples/mouse_events.thumbnail.jpg) This example shows the use of the [Supervisor API](../reference/supervisor.md) to retrieve mouse events.
When the simulation is running, the [Supervisor](../reference/supervisor.md) controller called `mouse_events.c` waits for a mouse event and displays in the `Console` the 3D and 2D coordinates of the mouse and the name of the hit object.
The controller of this simulation is blocking, which means it will block until a mouse click is detected and it will not advance the simulation time.
An alternative non blocking controller called `mouse_events_non_blocking.c` is also available for this example.

**Keywords**: [ContactProperties](../reference/contactproperties.md), rolling friction

![rolling_friction.png](images/samples/rolling_friction.thumbnail.jpg) In this example is demonstrated the principle of rolling friction.
The physics engine (ODE) supports up to three coefficients, commonly referred to as rho, rho2, and rhoN.
The black marbles are free to roll, however they are subject to different values of rho and therefore some take longer than others to accelerate.
The green marbles are also free to roll, but are given an initial lateral velocity.
The resulting lateral movement is limited to varying degrees due to having different values of rho2.
Lastly, the blue marbles are initially spun around the Z axis and they come to a halt at different moments because they have different values of rhoN.

![supervisor_draw_trail.png](images/samples/supervisor_draw_trail.thumbnail.jpg) In this example, a [Supervisor](../reference/supervisor.md) controller draws a green path behind a target node.
The target node is a [Pose](../reference/pose.md) node mounted in the `turretSlot` of a moving e-puck robot.
At the beginning of the simulation, the [Supervisor](../reference/supervisor.md) controller creates programmatically an `IndexedLineSet` node.
Then at each simulation step, it uses the target node position to update the `IndexedLineSet` node fields.

It can be changed from the graphical user interface in the scene tree and also from a [supervisor](../reference/supervisor.md) process as demonstrated in this example.
If a texture is not found, it is replaced with a default image as shown on the picture.

![vision.png](images/samples/vision.thumbnail.jpg) This example demonstrates the use of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to process the camera image.
The robot acquires images from a colored scene.
This controller requires [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to be installed (not embedded in Webots), it should therefore be compiled with the `OPENCV_DIR` environment variable set.
The [Camera](../reference/camera.md) image is given to OpenCV, OpenCV filters are applied on the image, and the result is displayed in a [Display](../reference/display.md) overlay.

### [ziegler\_nichols.wbt]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects/samples/howto/ziegler_nichols/worlds/ziegler_nichols.wbt)

**Keywords**: PID control, Ziegler-Nichols method, plot

![ziegler_nichols.png](images/samples/ziegler_nichols.thumbnail.jpg) This example shows the use of the `wb_motor_set_pid` function.
It adapts its PID parameters as specified by the [Ziegler-Nichols tuning method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziegler%E2%80%93Nichols_method).
Each P-controller is tested during a period of 400 time steps, i.e. 12.8 seconds.
A P-controller 'succeeds' if a constant error amplitude repeats at least 10 times during the test period.
Otherwise the proportional gain P is incremented by 10 and the experiment restarts.
The tuned Ziegler-Nichols "ultimate" gains will be computed for the first successful controller.
The result is plot in a [Display](../reference/display.md) overlay.
