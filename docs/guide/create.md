### Samples

You will find the following sample in this folder: "WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/irobot/create/worlds".

#### create.wbt

![create.wbt.png](images/robots/create/create.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) This simulation shows the Create robot which cleans a small apartment.
The robot moves straight ahead.
When hitting an obstacle or detecting a virtual wall, the robot turns randomly.
The dust on the ground is a texture of a [Display](../reference/display.md) device managed by a [Supervisor](../reference/supervisor.md) controller.
The [Supervisor](../reference/supervisor.md) draws transparent circles into this texture at the robot's location to simulate cleaning dust.
