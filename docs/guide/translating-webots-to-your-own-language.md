## Translating Webots to your own Language

Webots is already translated into French, German, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese (and partially into Italian).
However, since Webots is always evolving, including new text or changing existing wording, these translations may not always be complete or accurate.
As a user of Webots, you are very welcome to help us fix these incomplete or inaccurate translations.
You can also provide translation files for a new language.
Your contribution is likely to be integrated into the upcoming releases of Webots, and your name acknowledged in this user guide.
To proceed with fixing a translation or adding a new one, please follow the instructions [here]({{ url.github_tree }}/resources/translations).
