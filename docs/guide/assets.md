# Assets

Since version R2022b, all the Webots assets are provided and documented on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto).
A keyword-based search is available so that you can explore them easily.
Any user can contribute their own assets to [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto) by hosting them on a public [GitHub](https://github.com) repository and registering them on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto) by pressing the "Add a new proto" button located at the bottom of the page.
In addition to standard objects, like chairs, flower pots, etc., they include some particular categories:

## Robots

All the robot models available in Webots are listed on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=robot) under the *robot* keyword.
They are derived from the [Robot](../reference/robot.md) node and include wheeled robots, tracked robots, legged robots, robotic arms, drones, etc.
The vehicles are a special category of robots, available on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=vehicle) under the *vehicle* keyword.

## Actuators

All the actuator assets are listed on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=actuator) under the *actuator* keyword.
They typically correspond to commercially available devices.
For generic actuators, see the [Actuators](actuators.md) section.

## Sensors

All the sensor assets are listed on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=sensor) under the *sensor* keyword.
They typically correspond to commercially available devices.
For generic sensors, see the [Sensors](sensors.md) section.

## Joints

Webots already disposes of several nodes to model the transmission of power across bodies, such as [HingeJoint](../reference/hingejoint.md), [Hinge2Joint](../reference/hinge2joint.md), [BallJoint](../reference/balljoint.md) and [SliderJoint](../reference/sliderjoint.md).
However, in some instances it is necessary to more accurately describe the real behavior by taking into consideration factors like, for example, the clearance among gears in a drive train, which induces a gear latch.
There are a couple of joint PROTO nodes allowing a more accurate modeling and available on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=joint) under the *joint* keyword.


## Appearances

All the [PBR appearance](../reference/pbrappearance.md) assets are listed on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=appearance).
They represent various materials and can be customized and re-used to create the appearance of other PROTO nodes.
