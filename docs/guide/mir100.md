## Mobile Industrial Robots' MiR100

%robot mir100 images/robots/mir100/model.thumbnail.png

Designed by Mobile Industrial Robots, [MiR100](mir100.md) is a six-wheeled robot: two of them, in the middle, are actuated, while the others are free caster wheels.
The model is a modular mobile platform used for logistics and indoor transport. It is well-suited for industries, as its design enables it to carry a payload of up to 100 kg.
It carries two [Lidars](../reference/lidar.md) and four sonar [DistanceSensors](../reference/distancesensor.md#sonar-sensors) designed for obstacle avoidance, as well as a [RangeFinder](../reference/rangefinder.md) at the front for navigation.
More information on the MiR100 robot can be found on the [constructor website](https://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/en/solutions/robots/mir100/).

#### MiR100 Field Summary

- `color`: Middle section color of the robot.
- `frontLidarSlot`: Extends the robot with a lidar on the front (such as the `SickS300` for example).
- `backLidarSlot`: Extends the robot with a lidar on the back (such as the `SickS300` for example).
- `bodySlot` : Extends the robot with new nodes (such as the `Robotino3Platform` for example).
