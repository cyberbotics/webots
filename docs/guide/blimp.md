### blimp\_lis.wbt

![blimp.png](images/robots/blimp/blimp.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) This is an example of the flying blimp robot developed at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems (LIS) at EPFL.
You can use your keyboard, or a joystick to control the Blimp's motion across the room.
Use the up, down, right, left, page up, page down and space (reset) keys.
Various [Pose](../reference/pose.md) and [IndexedFaceSet](../reference/indexedfaceset.md) nodes are used to model the room using textures and transparency.
A *physics plugin* is used to add thrust and other forces to the simulation.

> **Note**:
[Fluid](../reference/fluid.md) and [Propeller](../reference/propeller.md) nodes are now recommended to create flying robots.
