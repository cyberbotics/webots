#### altino.wbt

![altino.wbt.png](images/robots/altino/altino.wbt.thumbnail.jpg) This simulation shows the ALTINO model in a simple environment.
The ALTINO controller, written in Python, shows a collision avoidance behavior based on a Braitenberg vehicle.
Alternatively, the vehicle can be controlled manually using the computer keyboard.
Please refer to the Webots console to learn the control keys.
