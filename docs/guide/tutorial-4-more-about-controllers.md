## Tutorial 4: More about Controllers (30 Minutes)

Now we start to tackle the topics related to programming robot controllers.
We will design a simple controller that avoids the obstacles created in the previous tutorials.

This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of robot programming in Webots.
At the end of this chapter, you should understand what is the link between the scene tree nodes and the controller API, how the robot controller has to be initialized and cleaned up, how to initialize the robot devices, how to get the sensor values, how to command the actuators, and how to program a simple feedback loop.

This tutorial only addresses the correct usage of Webots functions.
The study of robotics algorithms is beyond the goals of this tutorial and so it won't be addressed here.
Some rudimentary programming knowledge is required to tackle this chapter (any C tutorial should be a sufficient introduction).
At the end of the chapter, links to further robotics algorithms are given.

### New World and New Controller

> **Hands on #1**: Save the previous world as `collision_avoidance.wbt`.
Create a new C (or any other language) controller called `epuck_avoid_collision` (for C++ and Java call it `EPuckAvoidCollision` instead) using the wizard.
Modify the `controller` field of the `E-puck` node in order to associate it to the new controller.

%spoiler "**Reminder**: How to create a new controller?"

Select `New Robot Controller...` from the `Wizards` menu Then, choose your programming language and the file name.

%end

### Understand the e-puck Model

Controller programming requires some information related to the e-puck model.
In order to create the collision avoidance algorithm, we need to read the values of its 8 infra-red distance sensors located around its turret, and we need to actuate its two wheels.
The way that the distance sensors are distributed around the turret and the e-puck direction are depicted in [this figure](#top-view-of-the-e-puck-model-the-green-arrow-indicates-the-front-of-the-robot-the-red-lines-represent-the-directions-of-the-infrared-distance-sensors-the-string-labels-corresponds-to-the-distance-sensor-names).

The distance sensors are modeled by 8 [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) nodes in the hierarchy of the robot.
These nodes are referenced by their `name` fields (from `ps0` to `ps7`).
We will explain later how these nodes are defined.
For now, simply note that a [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) node can be accessed through the related module of the Webots API (through the `webots/distance_sensor.h` include file).
The values returned by the distance sensors are scaled between 0 and 4096 (piecewise linearly to the distance).
While 4096 means that a big amount of light is measured (an obstacle is close) and 0 means that no light is measured (no obstacle).

The **controller API** is the programming interface that gives you access to the simulated sensors and actuators of the robot.
For example, including the `webots/distance_sensor.h` file allows to use the `wb_distance_sensor_*` functions and with these functions you can query the values of the [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) nodes.
The documentation on the API functions can be found in [Reference Manual](../reference/nodes-and-api-functions.md) together with the description of each node.

### Program a Controller

We would like to program a very simple collision avoidance behavior.
You will program the robot to go forwards until an obstacle is detected by the front distance sensors, and then to turn towards the obstacle-free direction.
In order to do that, we will use the simple feedback loop depicted in the UML state machine in [this figure](#uml-state-machine-of-a-simple-feedback-loop).

The complete code of this controller is given in the next subsection.

%tab-component "language"
%tab "C"
> **Hands on #2**: At the beginning of the controller file, add the include directives corresponding to the [Robot](../reference/robot.md), the [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) and the [Motor](../reference/motor.md) nodes in order to be able to use the corresponding API:
> ```c
> #include <webots/robot.h>
> #include <webots/distance_sensor.h>
> #include <webots/motor.h>
> ```
Just after the include statements add a macro that defines the duration of each physics step.
This macro will be used as argument to the `wb_robot_step` function, and it will also be used to enable the devices.
This duration is specified in milliseconds and it must be a multiple of the value in the `basicTimeStep` field of the [WorldInfo](../reference/worldinfo.md) node.
> ```c
> #define TIME_STEP 64
> ```
%tab-end

%tab "C++"

> ```cpp
> #include <webots/Robot.hpp>
> #include <webots/DistanceSensor.hpp>

This duration is specified in milliseconds and it must be a multiple of the value in the `basicTimeStep` field of the [WorldInfo](../reference/worldinfo.md) node.
> ```cpp

> ```
Finally, use the `webots` namespace which is required to use the webots classes.
> ```cpp
>// All the webots classes are defined in the "webots" namespace
>using namespace webots;
> ```
%tab-end

%tab "Python"
> **Hands on #2**: At the beginning of the controller file, add the import directives corresponding to the [Robot](../reference/robot.md), the [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) and the [Motor](../reference/motor.md) nodes in order to be able to use the corresponding API:
>```python
> from controller import Robot, DistanceSensor, Motor
>```
Just after the import statements define a variable that defines the duration of each physics step.
This macro will be used as argument to the `Robot::step` function, and it will also be used to enable the devices.
This duration is specified in milliseconds and it must be a multiple of the value in the `basicTimeStep` field of the [WorldInfo](../reference/worldinfo.md) node.

> ```java
> import com.cyberbotics.webots.controller.Robot;
> import com.cyberbotics.webots.controller.DistanceSensor;
> import com.cyberbotics.webots.controller.Motor;
> ```
Just after the import statements create the `EPuckAvoidCollision class` (the name of the class should match exactly the name of the file) and the `main` function.
In the `main function`, define a variable that defines the duration of each physics step.
This macro will be used as argument to the `Robot::step` function, and it will also be used to enable the devices.
This duration is specified in milliseconds and it must be a multiple of the value in the `basicTimeStep` field of the [WorldInfo](../reference/worldinfo.md) node.
> ```c
> public class EPuckAvoidCollision {

The `main` function is where the controller program starts execution.
The arguments passed to the `main` function are given by the `controllerArgs` field of the [Robot](../reference/robot.md) node.
The Webots API has to be initialized using the `wb_robot_init` function and it has to be cleaned up using the `wb_robot_cleanup` function.

A robot device is referenced by a `WbDeviceTag`.
The `WbDeviceTag` is retrieved by the `wb_robot_get_device` function.
Then it is used as first argument in every function call concerning this device.
A sensor such as the [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) has to be enabled before use.
The second argument of the enable function defines at which rate the sensor will be refreshed.

### Solution: World File

To compare your world with the solution, go to your files and find the folder named "my\_first\_simulation" created in [Tutorial 1](tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots.md), then go to the "worlds" folder and open with a text editor the right world.
[This solution]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects/samples/tutorials/worlds/collision_avoidance.wbt) as the others is located in the [solution directory]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects/samples/tutorials/worlds/).

### Conclusion

Here is a quick summary of the key points you just learned:

- The controller entry point is the `main` function like any standard C program.
- No Webots API function should be called before the call of the `wb_robot_init` function.
- The last function to call before leaving the main function is the `wb_robot_cleanup` function.
- A device is referenced by the `name` field of its device node.
The reference of the node can be retrieved thanks to the `wb_robot_get_device` function.
- Each controller program is executed as a child process of the Webots process.
A controller process does not share any memory with Webots (except the cameras' images) and it can run on another CPU (or CPU core) than Webots.
- The controller code is linked with the "libController" dynamic library.
This library handles the communication between your controller and Webots.

This [section](controller-programming.md) explains in more details controller programming.
You should read it carefully to go further with robot programming in Webots.
