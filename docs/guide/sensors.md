## Sensors

Webots can simulate a lot of standard robotic sensors.
Using the nodes described [below](#generic-sensor-list) and their corresponding API is sufficient in most of the cases.

More specific sensors are built on the top of these generic nodes, thanks to the [PROTO system](../reference/proto.md).
These sensors are listed on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=sensor) under the *sensor* keyword.
They typically correspond to commercially available devices.

### Camera Sensors

Adding a generic [Camera](../reference/camera.md) node is sufficient for most of the applications.
Generic cameras are customizable (resolution, field of view, noise, etc.) and include a zoom and a focusing mechanism by default.
Special effects like motion blur, various models of noise, lens distortion and the use of a spherical or cylindrical projection are available.
If a [Recognition](../reference/recognition.md) node is added to the camera, the camera can return not only the image but also all objects detected in the camera image and their size and position.
It is therefore very easy to simulate smart cameras such as the Mobileye.

Alternatively, camera models corresponding to real-world device can be found on [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=sensor/camera).

### Lidar Sensors

In addition to the generic [Lidar](../reference/lidar.md) node, a wide range of commercial lidar sensors have been modelled and are available from [webots.cloud](https://webots.cloud/proto?keyword=sensor/lidar).
