# Sample Webots Applications

This chapter gives an overview of sample worlds provided with the Webots package.
The example worlds can be tested easily; the ".wbt" files are located in various "worlds" directories of the "[WEBOTS\_HOME/projects]({{ url.github_tree }}/projects)" directory and can be directly opened from Webots using the `Open Sample World` item in `File` menu.
The controller code is located in the corresponding "controllers" directory.
This chapter provides only a short abstract for each example.
More detailed explanations can be found in the source code.
