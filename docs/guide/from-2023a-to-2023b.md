# Upgrade from R2023a to R2023b
The R2023b version of Webots introduces a new type of node: the [Pose](../reference/pose.md) node.
It has been introduced to solve an issue regarding scale: until R2023b, solid, robots and devices had a scale parameter.
However scaling such nodes was the cause of a lot of bugs and inconsistency.
Moreover, in a lot of cases, it did not make sense to scale such node: you could scale down a car but motor's power where not scaled for example.

This is where the Pose node comes in.

## What Changes
### What Is the Pose Node

The Pose node is a descendant of [Group](../reference/group.md) and replace [Transform](../reference/transform.md) as the parent of [Solid](../reference/solid.md) and [Fluid](../reference/fluid.md).
It has exactly the same fields than a transform but for the `scale`.
You can see the complete node hierarchy [here](../reference/node-chart.md).

### What Becomes of the Transform Node

The Transform node is still there and can be used to scale `Geometry`.

*Note*: a Transform node cannot be inserted in a `bounding object` and cannot contain any `Solid` nodes.

## Adapt Your Projects
### How to Adapt Your Worlds
A backward compatibility mechanism has been implemented to automatically convert old worlds during loading.
It works as follows:
  - For each `Transform`, it checks whether or not the scale has the default value: `1 1 1`.
  - If it is the case, it creates a `Pose` instead of a `Transform`.

Saving the world will save the conversion to the world file.

In several cases, you will need to fix the world by yourself:
  - If a non default scale is in a `Solid` node or a node derived from `Solid`.
  - A non default `scale` is present in a `Transform` that is in a forbidden place like a `bounding object` or that have `Solid` children.

### How to Adapt Your Protos

The backward compatibility mechanism also works for protos.
However, saving the world will have no effect on the protos, which means that they will be converted at every loading.
To fix that, you can either convert them by hand or use the [convert\_transform\_to\_pose.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/master/scripts/converter/convert_transform_to_pose.py).

*Note*: the script has several limitations:
  - It does not support protos with templating.
  - It requires the protos/worlds to be well formated.
  - It does not convert the parameters of the protos.
