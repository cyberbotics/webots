##### GeoCSBI 01/02/2022 14:45:37
Hey everyone and happy new year! I was working with MuliSense21 in an older version of Webots (2020 i believe). The range finder object could successfully retrieved according to the documentation, i.e., getDevice("Multisense21 meta range finder"). 



However in 2022a version, the Multisense21.proto missing the name field in the meta range finder object ->    

  RangeFinder {

        translation 0.05 0 0

        fieldOfView IS 

        cameraFieldOfView

        minRange 1.5

        maxRange IS 

        rangeFinderMaxRange

        width IS cameraWidth

        height IS cameraHeight

        noise IS rangeFinderNoise

      }



So it is not possible to get the object according documentation. Am I missing something?


`@DDaniel` Thank you!

hello, I am quite new. I am trying to put some models from blender into a world, but when I add physics they are broken and fall in the floor or bounce around weirdly. What could be the issue?

Oh yeah, so weBots just cannot handle more complicated mesh very well?


and will make it unstable

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:15:05
Webots use the bounding objects to calculate the physics behavior,  if your bounding objects are more complex, the calculations is too


Other solution is set the basicTimeStep of the WoldInfo in low value


Maybe between 8 to 16

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:17:18
Okay, how can I create a group of bounding objects to represent a object with multiple parts?


Okay I will try doing that, thank you for your help 😃

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:21:42
You welcome!

##### Jan Weber 01/04/2022 13:39:50
Hello,

I have a problem with meshes and their appearance. When I create a Solid with a Box as geometry and for example RedBricks as appearance, everything works as expected: I get a box of red bricks.

However, when I use a Mesh as geometry, I get the correct geometry, but it is gray and the RedBrick texture is not visible.

Does anyone have any idea what could be the reason for this?

Here is my code:



Solid {

  children [

    Shape {

      # Does not work:

      geometry Mesh { url "walls.stl" }

      # But this works:

      # geometry Box { size 2 2 2 }

      appearance RedBricks{}

    }

  ]

}



Jan


That is the stl for my question

##### Max\_K 01/04/2022 15:06:50
hello i have a question about the coordinates system and transforms. The default setting of the coordinate system in the spot world and all other sample projects is NUE. Default should be ENU or? Anyway, I believe that ROS uses ENU. 

In webots I set the coordsystem to ENU and rotated the floor so that nothing falls. The transforms from the spot in webots point in the wrong direction and that's why I think it looks wrong in rviz.

Do I have to rotate all the transforms from the spot manually?

is it possible to have 2021b and 2022a installed at the same time? I currently still have a "world" that does not run under 2022a.

##### black\_hammer\_67 01/04/2022 20:21:14
Hello, I'm trying to setup an underwater scenario, do you have any idea for how to make floating objects on the water ? I already tried by changing the density of the object but it did not paid off.

##### weyho 01/05/2022 09:33:11
Hello,

currently I am getting a segfault, when i am trying to open my world build in 2021b with 2022a, is there anyway to recover my world and continue to use it in 2022a since I would like to stay up to date?

##### mcitir 01/05/2022 18:28:36
Hello, I want to apply some autonomous driving functions. So, I started to use webots. I am working on highway\_overtake tutorial. Do you know how I can extract or record point data cloud of lidars? I want to work on data set outside of webots. Also, I want to visualize point cloud data. But I am not familiar with ROS. Any idea how to possible recording with python script only?

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:15:16
Hello everyone,

I'm trying to simulate a hexapod. Like the "mantis" in the sample files. However, the design of my robot has a more complex structure and the robot fails. The warning from the console is as follows; "WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep." 

Can I give it a rectangular physics like in the "mantis" robot, without changing the robot's design? Or how can I give?


and this is the mantis geometry

I tried lowering basicTimeStep but the error persisted


i guess i should use box geometry but i dont know how can i do it, when i add box in the geometry, the appearance is changing

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:26:02
you need to set in the `boundingObject` field of the yellow Solid, not geometry

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:27:35
the position of the box I added must be in the same position as the leg, right?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:28:11
You probably need to add a `Transform` node before the `Box` node in order to place it at the right spot

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:34:32
Should I add the transform inside children?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:35:57
```
boundingObject Transform {
  translation a b c
  children [
    Box {
      size x y z
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:43:40
I can't add box in children. What am i doing wrong?


there is no box in list

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:46:32
Should be possible. What about `Shape`? Can you add that before the `Box`?

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:47:01
oops, i find the problem, my mistake


I was trying to add in the wrong place

##### giunas97 01/09/2022 10:48:20
Hi, i'm using a kuka youbot and an e-puck in my project. But the youbot needs the contact properties defined in the WorldInfo node to work properly (for example, in my case, if these aren't defined, the youbot cannot reach the precise target point with the gps node). So, i entered the contact properties, now the youbot works properly, but the e-puck doesn't move straight. Any suggest to solve this problem? Thanks in advance


Not matter, solved. The problem was the basicTimestep

##### Ranga Kulathunga 01/09/2022 15:10:17

hi guys


I have a question


are there any body here

##### Lavi 01/09/2022 17:26:52
Hi.

I'd like to add a stationary camera to my scene that does not move with my robot (arm). Trying to add a camera at the top level I get a message saying this is not possible.

If there some way to add a stationary camera?

##### shpigi 01/09/2022 21:18:17
I wish to control a ur10e arm and two stationary cameras with a single supervisor.

I tried nesting the arm and cameras in a single robot node as in the image below.



I can now get and enable the cameras within the supervisor `__init__` like so:

```
        self.st2_cam = self.getDevice("st2_cam")
        self.st2_cam.enable(self.timestep)
        self.st1_cam = self.getDevice("st1_cam")
        self.st1_cam.enable(self.timestep)
```

but I can not see the ur10 sensors. 

this:

```
        shoulder_pan_joint = self.getFromDef("ARM").getDevice("shoulder_pan_joint_sensor")
```

fails with `AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'getDevice'`



and this:

```
        shoulder_pan_joint = self.getDevice("shoulder_pan_joint_sensor")
```

returns None with a warning `Warning: "shoulder_pan_joint_sensor" device not found.`



Same for:

```
        shoulder_pan_joint = self.getDevice("ROBOT.ARM.shoulder_pan_joint_sensor")
```



How can I get both the arm and cams to work under the same supervisor?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/10/2022 17:32:00
If it's shipped with webots then indeed is defined as a PROTO


I don't know what you intend to do, but as a heads up internal nodes cannot be modified (not even with a supervisor). So if you intend to do something beyond just reading its position/state, you might want to convert it from a PROTO to a normal node (by right click and "convert to base node")


That you can do from the arm's controller yes

##### shpigi 01/10/2022 17:49:24
.. i.e. with this controller hierarchy

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:06:32
This code-block shows you all devices, and this specifically puts all motors and position sensors in a list. But it prints ALL devices, so you can add other sensors.



> **Attachment**: [webots\_init\_devices.py](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/930266974196498472/webots_init_devices.py)


If you want to use an inverse kinematics controller I made (and which works very well), check out this repository. I have not checked it recently with the UR10e, but i did in the past and it worked flawlessly


[https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots\_pyikfast\_tutorial](https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots_pyikfast_tutorial)


I uploaded a solver for the ur10e I had lying around, but I have not tested building the module and testing it

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:15:31
I really appreciate it `@Simon Steinmann` . Going to give all of it a try

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:26:13
did you turn the robot node of the ur10e into a solid?

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:27:31
I converted to Base Node and now this is my tree:

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:28:45
create a new solid next to the 2 cameras. Then cut - copy all the ur10e's children to the solids children


perhaps also put the translation and rotation to the same values


then delete the "DEF ARM Robot" node


The issue is that you have nested Robot nodes. A robot is a node that starts a controller and has access to its own devices.


so you should only have your highest level robot node, if you want to control everything with one controller

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:37:22
`@Simon Steinmann` , you're a genius! I went into a text editor, replaced the `DEF ARM Robot` with `Solid` and it worked!

This is your code's output:

```INFO: ur10_supervisor_manager: Starting controller: python -u ur10_supervisor_manager.py

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:38:00
😎  Awesome! that is a much smarter way to do it


If you want to get IK to work properly, I highly suggest you use my repository. I spent half a year with that stuff, and it is by far the best solution that is out there and compatible without complex other frameworks

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:40:31
Sounds great. Will do. I'm aiming at some reinforcement learning work and controlling the end-effector in Cartesian space (instead of doing actions in joint space) is very promising IMO

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:41:16
then you kind of HAVE to use my repo. That was exactly what I was doing. I added support for cartesian velocity control without error drift


and it is very fast, in the dozens to hundreds of microseconds per solution instead of milliseconds


but dont expect too much from RL with robotic arms. Spend about 2 years with it

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:42:36
I'll be sure to let you know how it goes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:43:02
If you wanna have a chat, feel free to pm me. Literally what I did my master thesis on and worked at the german NASA for 1 year 🙂

##### Jan Weber 01/11/2022 11:21:28
Hello, is it possible to have a proto inherit from another proto? I want to extend the "TurtleBot3Burger.proto" with some sensors. So far I just copied it and made my changes in it (not in a field, but in children). But due to the change of the coordinate systems in R2022a I would now have to maintain different versions of the proto file for the different webots versions. Therefore it would be easier to let my modified proto inherit from the "official" proto and put only my changes there.

Or is the only way to do that via the extensionSlots?

Jan


I have another question: According to [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2022-a-release](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2022-a-release) webots\_ros2\_driver replaces the older webots\_ros2\_core. In the webots\_ros2\_core/launch/robot\_launch.py there was the possibility to specify the robot name so that the robot controller finds the associated robot in webots. I am missing this possibility in webots\_ros2\_driver.

I want to launch multiple external robot controllers from one ROS launchfile.

Also the possibility to work with environment variables (as described in [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)) fails in the context of ROS launchfiles, because the nodes are not started in a fixed time sequence.

The old way of specifying the robot name in the launchfile worked very well. Does anyone have an idea how to solve the problem?

##### moebius 01/12/2022 23:42:51
Hi I have a supervisor file that is generating the arena for the environment and managing running the sims for multiple robot designs , and I want to read some data from a json file for a given robot and pass those parameters to the customData field for the robot  using 

```
supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')
topLevelNodes.getMFNode(-1)
robot.getField('customData').setSFString(data['geometry_params'])
```

 but i do not see this reflected in the customData field in the GUI tree for the robot node, and hence I am not able to access the data in the controller file



What am i doing wrong, and how am i supposed to be passing the data to the controller?

##### pyphais 01/13/2022 08:09:15
Hi all, I'm trying to make a skid-steer vehicle simulation accurate to the physical vehicle I have. I've set it up so that the available torque for each wheel at each step is based on the speed of the wheel, and approximated a linear torque-speed curve, then I attempt to set the velocity for each wheel and it uses the available torque to do it. I figured this is more accurate than simply picking an acceleration as the motors do not have that information. The vehicle seems to be getting to the correct speed doing this (its max speed is dependent on the torque available at that speed), but it is accelerating much too quickly. The physical vehicle takes about 1/4 of the wheel to get up to speed, and another quarter turn of the wheel to come to a complete stop when the throttle is let go, but the simulated vehicle seems to do both nearly instantaneously. Lowering the available torque just lowers the max speed that the vehicle gets to instead of affecting the accelerations, increasing friction makes it worse, decreasing friction makes it slide instead of continuing turning the wheel. I'm not sure what parameters to edit in order to make it have the same behavior as the real vehicle. The only thing that gets me that behavior is increasing the mass of the wheels from 0.7kg to like 50kg each, but this is definitely not the case for the real vehicle. Does anyone have any advice?

##### mouselet2017 01/16/2022 13:31:56
When I used webots to simulate led lights, I used the following code:

from controller import Robot

from controller import LED



robot = Robot()

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

led = robot.getDevice("led")

print(led)

print(led.get())

led.set(1)

print(led.get())

while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    led.set(1)

    pass



But unfortunately, my led doesn't light up, and I don't know why (console output is fine). Hope someone can help me! THANKS!!!

I'm having issues using Webots R2022a, when I try `from controller import Robot` I get the following error: `ImportError: my_webots_home/webots/lib/controller/python38/_controller.so: undefined symbol: _ZNK6webots3GPS14getSpeedVectorEv`. The error does not occur when I revert back to Webots R2021b and the issue shows up for the deb as well as the tar package of Webots 2022a. Does anyone know what may be causing this?


Ah, I see my `PYTHONPATH` also referenced to an old location of webots, removing the old reference fixed the issue!

I'm using webots with ros\_control, but since that means I have to use the default `"ros"` controller (right?), I can no longer access the motor devices within the controller to set the initial position. How can I provide initial positions to motor joints?

##### Mat198 01/20/2022 11:49:30
I'm trying to use the robot.worldSave() command without an argument as explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_world\_save](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_world_save)



I keep getting this error msg:

Error: wb\_supervisor\_world\_save() called with a NULL 'filename' argument.



I don't want to explicitly give the world name as I want to use the same code for multiple worlds.



I need to generate multiple objects and save so I don't need to create then every single time I run the sim.



Thanks in advance

##### Jan Weber 01/21/2022 14:12:42
I am currently converting my project from the old webots\_ros2\_core to the webots\_ros2\_driver. I am using webots\_ros2\_turtlebot. I noticed that the tf2-tree of the turtlebot is not connected: (see tf2\_tree\_splitted.png)

In webots 2021a with webots\_ros2\_core it was fully connected. 

My understanding is that the tree should be completely built by the driver, right? I have now extended the robot\_launch.py from webots\_ros2\_turtlebot:



    extension\_slot\_publisher = Node(

        package='tf2\_ros',

        executable='static\_transform\_publisher',

        output='screen',

        arguments=['-0.03', '0', '0.153', '0', '0', '0', 'base\_link', 'extension\_slot'],

    )



    lidar\_publisher = Node(

        package='tf2\_ros',

        executable='static\_transform\_publisher',

        output='screen',

        arguments=['0', '0', '0.02', '0', '0', 'extension\_slot', 'LDS-01'],

    )



Now the tree is fully connected and the navigation works: (see tf2\_tree.png)



I am unsure if this is the right way. I rarely get this warning, which to my understanding indicates that someone is publishing the transformation between LDS-01 and base\_link:



[controller\_server-11] [INFO] [1642773577.942406284] [local\_costmap.local\_costmap\_rclcpp\_node]: Message Filter dropping message: frame 'LDS-01' at time 0.864 for reason 'the timestamp on the message is earlier than all the data in the transform cache'.

When I run  `ros2 launch webots_ros2_turtlebot robot_launch.py` I have this tree, so I guess you are missing something.

Maybe by looking here ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_turtlebot/launch/robot\_launch.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_turtlebot/launch/robot_launch.py)) you will find out what is wrong / missing, otherwise I think it would be easier to open an issue on `webots_ros2` so we can take a look more in depth.

##### Max\_K 01/21/2022 15:31:09
Hello, i try to add a TouchSensor to the spot robot. I followed the tutorial setting-up a Robot Simulation. I am able to add a Distance Sensor as described in updating my\_robot.urdf and had the ros topic also available. But when i try to add a TouchSensor i get the error:

```[driver-2] wb_device_init(): node not handled

what could be the reason? I am using ros foxy

##### kindleforjc 01/21/2022 21:49:33
Hello all, just started with Webots Automotive and python. I am trying to make small example where car can reach up to some solid node.



I am trying to use the supervisor API in  python but it says "Only one instance of the Root class should be created".



So can anyone help me understand the error? Does this mean that when we add any Car/Vehicle and set the Supervisor field to True... In background one instance of that robot is already created?



Is there any way to access the self instance in python for vehicle?



Thank you and sorry if my questions are not clear.

You mean the included sample world kid.wbt, or it's a custom one (from a previous version of webots)?

##### giaco\_mz 01/22/2022 18:58:01
the included one


Now setting field size on kid to the adult one i have this error, it could be related

after this error also the adult one with the field size parameter set to kid crash

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/22/2022 19:05:19
That error is from the physics engine, I think something is very wrong with your version, something might have been corrupted. I suggest you try to completely uninstall webots and reinstall it

##### giaco\_mz 01/22/2022 19:06:18
ok, one question can you give me some advice to speed up this kind of simulation please?


from webots settings point of view

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/22/2022 19:15:10
these simulations are meant to be very realistic, so they are especially heavy. If you don't need that much, disabling `backlash` modeling would help (set the corresponding flag to false), and disable `turfPhysics` for the ground. Disabling rendering also helps, but there's not much else you can do, it depends a lot on your system too

##### giaco\_mz 01/22/2022 19:18:31
Ok perfect thx a lot you were very helpfull

##### Yosi F 01/25/2022 14:38:43
I had a similar issue


I was using an older version of webots. when I upgraded, everything worked

##### moebius 01/26/2022 03:47:32
if a .wbo file i am importing into webots has the coordinate system with the x axis pointing up and the arena has the coordinate system with the y axis pointing up (a +90 deg rotation about the z axis basically) , is there anyway I can change the coordinate systems of either of them so they match? I need to use a compass and the values are obviously not usable at the moment. Or should I do some transformation in the controller itself to use the compass values? would really appreciate the help, i am a bit stuck here.

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/26/2022 09:57:47
I'm trying to rebuild a RC-car in webots which we are using for several university projects to test self-driving algorithms. Its a Audi q2 scaled with 1:8 (see picture). I am using the Car.proto to allow working with the webots driver library, but when i down-scaled everything with the real dimensions of our car, I have the following problem: Using 4x4 is working but it seems that the car is "slipping" over the front wheels as soon as I steer into a curve (like the friction of the front wheels is to low and the rear wheels are pushing the car ahead instead of steering correctly..). Since our real car has only a rear motor, I would like to use the "propulsion" type of car.proto. But this is not working for such small-scaled cars like I want. With propulsion the front tires are blocking/fixed and do not rotate. 



I also tested the example proto of the saeon altino car. This is by default a 4x4 type, but when I change it to propulsion, its front wheels are also blocking. 



Could it be that there is a kind of a bug with the car.proto which only work for (nearly) realistic dimensions but not when working with small-scaled cars?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2022 09:59:38
Are you using the `scale` parameter to scale it down? This scaling should only be used on geometries, not at the robot level

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/26/2022 10:02:58
No I just use `scale` on my created mesh/stl files. I have measured all dimensions from the real car and modified the values in the car.proto (e.g. `trackFront = 0.2` or `wheelbase=0.36`) and also created a new wheel.proto with measured values


Well, this could be since I dont have adapt all of them. But 1. For some values I dont know exactly what plausible values would be (some are unitless so i dont know the plausible range or on what they depend) and 2. This would Not explain, why the saeon altino have the same Problem when changing from 4x4 to propulsion. I think the other parameters of the altino should be adapted well for the mini car?

Why am I unable to find skin animated characters in R2022a?


ok great!


What values shall i give to trajectory, speed and step in human.py?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/28/2022 08:33:55
what is human.py? your own controller? normally you need .BVH files that define the animation the character will play

##### amna 01/28/2022 08:45:48
`@DDaniel` Yes, it is a controller of pedestrian.


It is in python and documentation says to add values of trajectory, speed and step to make the pedestrian move

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/28/2022 08:55:02
pedestrian is a different thing, a sample of that is also available (`file > open sample world > humans > pedestrian`). If you use the pedestrian.py controller you need to specify in the `controllerArgs` field these properties, `--trajectory` specifies the path the human will take, `--speed` the speed it should run at and `--step` the timestep. If you look at that example it should be fairly clear

Hello everyone

I am working on a prosthesis project. Therefore, I would like to have a human model, maybe a CharacterSkin (simulated using .bvh files), "cut" its leg, and replace it with our prosthesis model.

Is that even possible in Webots? And any idea on how to do so?

##### ToKi 02/01/2022 21:06:34
Hey there,

so I have this older Webots-project for demonstrating line follower robots for a course I'm holding. The model is based on the e-puck model with a normal "infra-red" type sensor set in the groundSensorsSlot. I use a black and white png set as the baseColorMap under RectangleArena/floorAppearance PBRAppearance as the track to follow. I previously had a R2020-version of Webots installed, where the model was still working. Since the students will most likely use the newest version, I today also upgraded to R2022a. Otherwise the model opens and runs fine, but the irSensor now delivers a constant value (1000 with the standard lookup table) Does anyone have any pointers, what might have happened in the last couple of versions? Is there some setting I need to tweak to get it working again? I couldn't find anything directly helpful in the release notes nor online, and playing aroud with the parameters didn't seem to do much either. Thanks!

I would like to use anywhere from 1-5, I tried with 1 and 5, for the 1 sensor I re-created the whole project from scratch but still got the same issue


I was originally using robot.getDistanceSensor() to get the handle to the object, now getDevice, which was deprecated somewhere along the way, not sure if there were some other changes apart from the API-change along the way, and whether it has anything to do with my problem 🙂

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/02/2022 16:40:48
Hey. As already mentioned I'm working with the car library to simulate our RC cars. As a next step i want to use our DRL framework to start learning. Therefore i would need some supervisor functions (e.g. reset simulation or groundtruth information..) currently i have implemented my own ros2 node which also acts as external webots controller with the car library. As Ive seen `car` seems to be the "Supervisor" of the `driver` but it has no real supervisor access. My question is: what would be the "nicest" solution? Define my car proto as supervisor and do a internal typecast on the supervisor node to also have access to the car/driver library OR add a separate Supervisor robot to my world as supervisor? In the last case i would have 2 external controllers since I also would like to use ros2 for the supervisor functions🤨


oh dear, shame on me... I rely on the Car.proto but forgot to add the supervisor field to it so I was unable to test it before i asked my (stupid) question.. Now it works fine and I have all supervisor power like I need. Thanks for this hint 🙂

Could you point me out with anything that comes to your mind regarding the following please?

1) I'd like to work mostly in 2D (but I guess I'll just go with 3D)

2) How to restrict an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom in one end of a bar (e.g. pin joint restricting x and y movement; fixed joint restricting x, y and rotation movement, etc).

3) Run multiple simulations, varying programmatically certain parameters of the Proto file

You can use in c :

In python is similar:

timeX =  robot.getTime()  #  obtain the run time simulation



You can combine with supervisor node to stop the run simulation, for example

The closest thing I can imagine is adding some joint as a children to the Solid that is that cylinder, and for its endpoint, defining a SolidReference with a value of "<static environment>". But the problem is that the joints I know how to use (Hinge and Slider) would give a degree of freedom that I don't want.

Is it possible to force a body to have a velocity in certain direction and then read the torque values of attached motors? 

I have a mechanism and want to know the input torque profile that would be needed to obtain certain motion in the other end of the mechanism.


My Webots was crashing; it was stuck thinking that it needed to run void.exe as a controller, even though in my world there is no supervisor==True nor controller "something" defined anymore.

It is related to my usage of SolidReference and "<static environment>", which I tried using because removing the physics node wasn't working anymore to fix a body for some reason (that's a different story).

Removing the SolidReference fixes the issue, but I still wonder why was it crashing in that way.

I'm trying to create several tracks with RoadSegments. When I add these in the world-file I can access the fields of each segment without problems (`getFromDef("ROAD1").getField("length").getSFFloat()`) But to keep my world file clean and make several track files, I introduced a new proto were I have some fields to re-use (e.g. `width/ lines`)  for all road segments and just list the roadSegments in a Group node (also with DEF). But when I try to access the fields of the grouped segments (`getFromDef("TRACK").getFromProtoDef("ROAD1").getField("length")...` I get invalid values for the fields of these segments. Is there a kind of access limitation?

hello I am trying to control the spot via ros2 with teleop. I have ported parts of the SoftServe repo: [https://github.com/SoftServeSAG/robotics\_spot/blob/temp\_robomaker/robot\_ws/src/rs\_inverse/scripts/SpotKinematics.py](https://github.com/SoftServeSAG/robotics_spot/blob/temp_robomaker/robot_ws/src/rs_inverse/scripts/SpotKinematics.py)

 

There is a SpotModel class which are initialized with parameters for the legs. As comment it says "Spot Micro Kinematics". 

Is the Spot in webots the "Micro" version or another one?

I don't know if these values are correct:

``` shoulder_length=0.110945,
elbow_length=0.3205,
wrist_length=0.37,
hip_x=2*0.29785,
hip_y=2*0.055,
foot_x=2*0.29785,
foot_y=2*0.2,
height=0.6,
com_offset=0.016,
shoulder_lim=[-0.78539816339744827899, 0.78539816339744827899],
elbow_lim=[-0.89884456477707963539, 2.2951079663725435509],
wrist\_lim=[-2.7929, -0.254801]
```



For the \_lim parameters, I have so far only specified the min/max position of the 3 motors.

The rest of the values I should be able to look up in the "spot.proto" or?

Hi, I'm not having luck fixing the endpoint of a slider joint. I'm trying for the endpoint to have a solid without a physics node, but the solid isn't being fixed.

I have:

`Robot (the beam) with physics and boundingObject -> HingeJoint -> Solid with physics (blue cylinder) -> SliderJoint -> Solid without physics (white cylinder)`

The blue cylinder seems to be attached to the white cylinder and dragging it down when the simulation starts.

Any ideas please?

I see that you started the model using the white cylinder as the base Robot node. It works but I still wonder if starting from the read beam would work somehow. Starting the modelling from the center read beam would be better because all the joints would descend from it, and would be easier to manage. Having the Robot node in the start or last element would create a huge tree underneath it.

Hi guys, I have a quick question: Do you know why my entire simulation restarts when i call `supervisor.step(1)`?

(For context: I'm calling it like this:

```py
if self.supervisor.step(self.timestep) == -1):
  exit()

```  i have checked that it's not just running  `exit()` and even when i call it in a `print` it just restarts)


Well the problem is that it doesn't return anything, not even -1, because before it can return anything, everything just restarts

I am trying to use extern controller on the robot(s) I have. The robot is mounted on a linear axis which traverses on one axis. The linear axis is modeled as a robot, so it has its own controller. For the linear axis motion , I use a sliderjoint with "LinearMotor" and "PositionSensor" devices. The structure looks like: LinearAxisRobot (LinearAxisController) -> children -> sliderjoint (LinearMotor and PositionSensor) ->  children -> UR10Robot.. I am trying with "extern" controller for both the robots to have sequential control. URRobot controller works fine with extern controller, that the joints move as expected. But linear axis controller isnt workin properly (from extern controller). The error is "AttributeError : Nonetype object has no attribute 'enable' " (for the position sensor).

Hi, I am using a slider joint in my robot arm and I'm using position control for it to move my robot arm. However, when the robot is traveling the robot arm keeps sliding automatically even when I have set the position to a standby location. Is there a way to hold the robot arm in a fixed position when it is not being used?

Hi all, is it possible to use `Supervisor` to make a paused world (maybe triggered by UI or streaming viewer) resume playing?


Thanks replies from`@DDaniel` and `@DrakerDG`. I created a simple world with one robot with `supervisor` set to true and wrote a simple controller.

```
from controller import Supervisor

s = Supervisor()

while s.step(16) != -1:
    if s.simulationGetMode() == Supervisor.SIMULATION_MODE_PAUSE:
        s.simulationSetMode(Supervisor.SIMULATION_MODE_REAL_TIME)
        s.step(0)
```

I clicked pause button in UI (Ctrl+0) and found that the controller does not take effect 😦

##### kimmcg 02/25/2022 09:36:40
Hi! I'm new here but I've been trying out webots for last few weeks now I am  currently in the process of making a Crazyflie model (small quadcopter).


I noticed that the meshes shape, when I want to use a .dae model, the visual aspects are not being imported with it. Also the orientation seems to be off then compared to an stl file.


Currently I build up the robot in parts in webots, and give each of them materials, but it is a bit tedious and hard to maintain, especially as a big part of the model is just visual with non moving parts.


But I would like to import the fiull body in one go as a dae file, with webots importing the material aspects as well. Would that be possible?


Ahh oke! maybe that is the reason why I saw those rotations  on each element in the colladashape proto as well?


I will indeed try out the nightly build, thanks!


cool, thanks for you help! I will try to finalize the model in the next few weeks but then soon Ill be able to contribute it to the webots github


it might seem that I'll need to wait a bit for a fix here for colladashapes  [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/4195](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/4195) I also noticed that relative URLs doesnt work, while it does for the meshes node

##### Kormit 02/25/2022 14:06:35
Hi, I was wondering if there is a way of programmatically, with a Supervisor robot, limiting the max velocity of a robots wheel motors. The issue i current have with setting the max velocity of the robot is that if the robot controller (not supervisor) sets the motor velocities once at the start of the program, the new max velocities don’t seem to come into effect until the robot controller tries to change them again. Is there any solution for this problem? Thanks.


In general, a robot controller sets its position to infinity and velocity to max at the very start of its controller. If the supervisor sets the robots max velocity to a new value, the new value only comes into effect if the robot controller resets its velocity values again. Is there a way to make this update happen regardless of what the robot controller does?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/25/2022 14:20:07
If you set the position to infinity it means you're controlling the motor in velocity and as the table shows, in velocity control calling `wb_motor_set_velocity` it specifies the desired velocity, not the maximal. The maximal velocity in this case is specified by changing the `maxVelocity` parameter of the motor (which you can do using a supervisor too)

##### Kormit 02/25/2022 14:28:39
From my tests, if you set a velocity higher than the new max before setting the new max by a supervisor, the robot doesn’t seem to slow down.


Could I be setting the max velocity via the supervisor incorrectly?

Thank you for the help it's very much appreciated. I tried running the  example in the webots:supervisor, but it's telling me that Def My\_robot isn't in my current world. I presume ive done something stupid but when i google the error it just brings me back to the same page. So im not entirely sure what its telling me is wrong


Currently, my world file looks like

I haven't touched it directly I've only added to it via the add a node button.  Would I put the DEF My\_Robot{Nao} or is it something more complicated.


And thank you for the help

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/28/2022 18:23:09
The last entry of your world Nao {...} just needs the prefix as i mentioned, so add "DEF My\_robot" before your Nao entry and it should work

##### josh101 02/28/2022 18:49:39
josh101 — Today at 18:47

Thanks for the help its very much appreciated. My only final question is that I have created a class called Nao which is a subclass of robot, and in such class, I have functions in which I can set the position of all its joints and what not. The only issue now is when i try and combine this im told I can only have one instance of Robot class. 



so what I'm asking is I'm  unsure how I would take 



supervisor = Supervisor()



robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("MY\_ROBOT")



CoM = robot\_node.getCenterOfMass()



 print(CoM)



And use it with a Nao class which is a subclass of Robot, once again thank you for the help theres no way i wouldve figured this out on my own

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/28/2022 19:50:13
You could try to not really built your Nao class as a inherited one of robot class, since you get all the functionality by the Supervisor object of your code snippet. So just implement a class (nao) and let this Just have a reference/attribute to the supervisor as you already mentioned. In your functions to control the joints eg, you can use either the supervisor or the robot\_node. if you set your robot to Supervisor = True in the world, you have a combined access to All functions of robot + supervisor.



At the moment with your world as pasted above, the supervisor call wont work since there is no object which can be accessed as supervisor (this could be your robot as I mentioned above or a extra dummy robot)

##### josh101 02/28/2022 20:02:25
But if i were to have it so my Nao class doesn't inherit from Robot, currently i move a limb by initiating  using 



self.limb = self.getDevice("limb") 



and then  later moving said limb using 



self.limb.setPosition(angle)





Im not really sure how id do it without inheriting the robot in this case though


And obviously i appreciate the help

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/28/2022 20:04:13
A Supervisor is a Robot with extra powers, instead of subclassing robot, you can subclass Supervisor.

##### josh101 02/28/2022 20:58:22
Thank you for all the Help 🙂


My only final concern is, is there a way to know what my coordinates are in reference to? Or can I set a reference point? At the moment I don't have a ground as I want him to set positions without kicking it and flying off, but then currently its really not clear as to what my my coordinates thus mean. Any help is very much appreciated

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/28/2022 21:12:38
`@josh101` coordinates you get from the supervisor are generally in reference to the world. I have not followed your whole thread so I dont know the specifics of the question.


what are you trying to achieve?

##### josh101 02/28/2022 21:15:57
I just want to look at how the CoM of my robot changes when I set it to different positions, and I can now read the CoM of my robot. But my coordinates don’t mean much as I can’t figure how what they’re in reference to. When you say they’re in reference to the world, is there a way to get this axis so I can see where it’s coming from. If that makes sense

I have the following problem i cant explain.. I'm using the latest docker image, start it with the provided command and add `--stream` since i want to use the Web streaming interface. With this it starts an empty world and i can connect to the streaming server from outside the container. When i mount the local folder with my world/controller files, i can start the simulation inside the container without the streaming server (needs nearly 5secs to load and start the world). But when i add the `--stream ` flag with my world, it hangs and the output of initializing the webserver (showing port) is not coming. 🤷‍♂️ so using container without stream works, but with it wont. Streaming works without loading my world. Its pretty confusing.. Any ideas/hints to check?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/01/2022 22:15:11
at least do a PD controller (you can probably leave the Integral error out)


for the D error you can just do `error - error_previous ` .  To get a true derivative, you would have to divide by your timestep, but that is a constant and can be skipped, assuming you never change your timestep. If you might change your timestep in the future, I would advice dividing by it.


`vertical_input = kp * P_error + kd * D_error`


And leave the P\_error linear, dont do a power


and instead of clipping an error, I would rather clip the final input signal to a stable range

Hi! I am currently working on W2022a and the webots\_ros2\_driver. Similiarly to the tesla\_driver and the mavik\_driver I built up a simulation. Everything is working fine, except that I am not able to evaluate supervisor functions as getPosition() etc although my vehicle has it's supervisor field set to active. Can somebody help me with my problem? Or is there any example available in the webots\_ros2 package which I can reuse to get a supevisory plugin? Thanks in advance!


I am not able to run "from controller import Supervisor" in my driver.py and therefore not able to run the code you recommended. The error is the following:ImportError: /usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38/\_controller.so: undefined symbol: \_ZNK6webots5Robot7getTypeEv

##### moebius 03/07/2022 23:40:42
Hi, when i am using the webots recording feature while running the simulations in headless mode with xvfb-run , the recordings are all blank, is there a way around it? Also when i record it in gui mode, the quality is pretty bad ( the quality parameter cannot seem to be set above 60, it doesn't record otherwise and this is something i saw mentioned in an issue on github as well)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/08/2022 01:19:34
Well it needs to render in order to record a video. So headless will not work. As for the quality, make sure the resolution is high enough. You might also have turned down a lot of the "nice" rendering options, or it is not supported (I am assuming you are using docker containers without gpu acceleration?)

##### moebius 03/08/2022 06:09:40
yes currently running it headless on docker containers without gpu acceleration but will run it on gpus soon.  Is there  any workaround to record it in headless mode, in situations like this?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/08/2022 06:52:09
software render on cpu is crappy always. You really need that gpu acceleration for anything visual. That includes visual sensors as well (lidar, camera etc.)


what do you need to record?


or why?

##### moebius 03/08/2022 07:31:54
so we want to run batches of simulations, and since those will be running on docker containers, we want the ability to record them as well

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/08/2022 07:35:13
add cameras in the simulation


that way you can explicitly controll all aspects of it

##### moebius 03/08/2022 17:12:03
okay so if i add cameras, i can record videos in headless mode as well??

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/08/2022 18:06:46
Yeah, but you need to do it through the controller. But perhaps wait for an <@&568329906048598039> dev to answer. There might be other solutions

Hi ! I am trying to build MoveIt2 on Windows using the recently provided information (deep thanks to whoever wrote/made that available !).

I am running into an issue when building, as cmake complains I don't have pkgconfig installed. Is it supposed to come with the ROS2 install ?

You have to install all dependencies

##### Mat198 03/10/2022 00:44:24
Type dxdiag in the windows menu to see


Sure. Hardware definitely isn't the problem


Did you try to reinstall and reset your computer?


Are you installing the last version?

##### Robokashi 03/10/2022 04:02:46
Are you accessing the computer remotely?

##### giaco\_mz 03/10/2022 09:08:28
there is a way to see the variable inside the simualtion in a different window?or the only way is to print it on console?


*variables


there will be possible otherwise to link,in some way, Spyder or other IDE to Webots?. So if Webots doesn't have this possibility hard-code implemented there is some work-around to do to overcome this problem?

##### Naxi 03/10/2022 21:01:08
Hi! I'm trying to spawn a node with a supervisor controller, using a .wbo file ,both are in the same folder. But when I run the controller, it only looks for the node file within the WEBOTS\_HOME path, and doesn't take into account the relative path to the controller. I'm working on a catkin workspace on an external C++ controller, and so far I've been able to access other nodes in the scene tree without issues

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 21:01:58
you have to get a handle to the current working directory

##### Naxi 03/10/2022 21:17:39
That did it, thanks!

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:33:17
I'm trying to track the center of mass of my bot, what would be the best way to do that?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:44:04
what language are you using?

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:44:11
python

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:44:42
okay, so in webots make sure you set ïs SUpervisor" to true


then in your controller, instead of 

`from controller import Robot`

you do

`from controller import Supervisor`

and initialize it as `robot = Supervisor()`


all robot commands work the same, but you have access to all supervisor functions on top of that


Now you need a handle to the node you want. If you want a handle to the robot itself you can do:

`robot_node = robot.getSelf()`


then to get the center of mass you do

`center_of_mass = robot_node.getCenterOfMass()`


this should be a vector [x, y, z] of the center of mass in world coordinates

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:50:18
I'll give that a try


Thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:50:32
let us know how it goes

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:52:20
I am getting the coordinates now!


my bot is a snake at the moment, and my head is the supervisor


so are these coordinates the center of the whole bot or just the head?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:53:49
it should be the combined center of mass of everything that is inside your node, so your robot with all its chilldren


but better to verify

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:55:32
ohhh, I have them as separate modules. module 1 is the supervisor
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/951614314870083604/unknown.png)
%end


so I think I'll be getting the coordinates of the first module.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:56:08
they are independent from each other? each with its own controller?

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:56:58
just one controller, with the supervisor emitting the motor rotation values

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:58:07
but the other modules need a controller to receive them right?

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:58:16
yes!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:58:25
so every one of them has its own controller

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 22:58:42
correct

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 22:58:58
yeah, then this does not work


I'm guessing you want to dynamically link and seperate modules during the simulation?

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:01:03
they are all linked to eachother with a motor, I just want to track the center of mass of the bot so maybe I could train it to optimize it's gait parameters.


would I be able to pick a module as it's center and track that

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:01:46
Is there a reason the have to be defined as individual robots and not a single robot?

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:02:57
I'd be controlling each point motor individually


based on a sine wave

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:03:22
they can all be inside the same robot for that

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:03:31
oh

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:03:47
the only reason to have it as separate robots would be swarm robots


that can dynamically link up

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:04:05
it's not a swarm

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:04:15
but if the robot in its configuration is fixed, just add them as children

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:04:43
how would the controller change in that case?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:05:12
you just need one controller and you initiallize all its motors and address them


is it rotational motors?

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:05:49
oh alright, I'll check it out

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:06:02
make sure the motors have unique names

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:06:17
but at the moment if I need to track the center module, is there any way?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:07:08
manually by getting all the center of masses and calculating the combined one


Just put it all in the same robot. you will save yourself tons of hassle

##### KENPACHI 03/10/2022 23:08:09
haha, will try


thank you very much.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2022 23:09:35

I've been working on a c-based pid controller for a small quadcopter, and I wrapped that with SWIG to a python  module for students to use in the python based webots controller

 The problem is, is that when I use the c based controller, the drone flies fine, but when I try the python controller with the same 

 wrapped c controller, I get the following error in the console: 

`WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.` 

The bounding boxes are already simple shapes (just a single cilinder), and I only have 4 joints, and I tried reducing the basic time step to 16 already. Also I get regular values for all four motors from the SWIG wrapped controller.

Hope that anybody could give me some more pointers to look at.

to file should be fine, but if you print a lot of info to the webots console it slows down noticeably. You can start webots with: `--stdout --stderr` to print to the terminal instead

Hi, I want to use Webots to generate Training Data for a neural network.

Is there any way to get the current timestamp of the simulation time (in python) or the elapsed time since the beginning of the simulation?

Since I dont get a 100% consistent speed its kinda tricky how many values I get per simulated Second.

As basicTimeStep I chose 8 and as Time\_Step for the controller I chose 64

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/17/2022 06:26:19
Check the api documentation for robot(). The function you are looking for is in there

Have you ever done waves upon the sea in PROTO file ? I don't think it's possible

##### S4JJ4D 03/17/2022 13:36:40
I'm trying a to use a PROTO  inside another PROTO but Webots is not able to parse the parent PROTO when I attempt to import it into the world.

.proto files are minimal and very simple and I can't figure out why things go wrong. files are attached. Can anyone please help me?

normal release or a nightly build?


I can't reproduce it, works fine for me and I don't see any issues with the protos themselves. Does adding the ChildNode proto work by itself?


weird indeed 🤨


and if you rename it back as it was now, does it work?


in the protos folder, if you display the hidden files (CTRL + h) you should find `.ParentNode.cache` and `.ChildNode.cache`, could you try to delete them?


the cache might be corrupted, it's the only possibility I can see

hello i need to ask a very important question. For some reason webots\_ros2 package doesnt work for me. ROS2 is perfectly installed and so is webots 2022a yet in the colcon build phase it leaves 11 packages aborted and doesnt work for ros2\_webots\_core and importer. I somehow made it work by bouncing around different versions of webots but the the example builds dont all work. For example ros2 launch webots\_ros2\_tesla robot\_launch.py works yet ros2 launch webots\_ros2\_tiago robot\_launch.py doesnt. Same with epuck and turtlebot. Please any help?


also webots\_ros2 says failing in github page i dont know if this is why.


i have followed everything excactly as it says. I am quite tech savvy and have performed many installations in various programms/packages/programming languages. I completed the procedure excactly as it says for ROS2, webots\_ros2 and webots

Hello everyone. Did anyone managed to successfully run Webots+ROS2 through WSL2 and Docker (with a Dockerfile)? If so, any tutorial suggestion for it? Since currently I seem to go through issues with the XServer (display), when trying to deploy it, using the official procedure [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#run-webots-in-docker-with-gui](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#run-webots-in-docker-with-gui)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/17/2022 23:15:00
it might be due to the absolute links of the mesh files. Urdf is usually structured with ROS packages. Or at least relative paths


However absolute paths should work. I did implement mesh path handling fixes a while back

hello everyone, I have a proto file translated from urdf and I open it in webots. When I want to drive differentially, I send cmd\_vel data, but the robot does not move forward even though the wheels are turning. I think the problem is with the physics plugin because for example, when I lift the robot a little bit and release it, it doesn't fall to the ground. How can I solve this problem?

Question: I'm trying to build a roach like robot within webots using the e-puck bot. I've successfully been able to make it avoid light using the built in light sensors. I've activated two children nodes on the ground sensor that are IR distance sensors, and I want them to be able to detect "food" and its "scent", so when it smells the scent, it knows food is nearby


I hope I'm explaining that well, any input would be appreciated, and thank you in advance for your time!

Hi there!

I'm automating some stuff in a supervisor node. Right now I want to implement a call that's part of the UI

I don't exactly know what to do to the children field to replace it with its default value (I mean, I guess I could delete all the nodes and insert the default value that's in the proto, but there must be a better way).

```
obstacles_children_field = robot.getFromDef("OBSTACLES").getField("children")
```

How would you proceed?



Thanks in advance!

thanks, Daniel, debugging I could do myself... but do not have access to the source code of the enable function of the S21 camera, which is part of the world model through a proto, how would you do it?


as I said other cameras, even the meta camera show the overlays fine


it is just the meta range finder which does not work with enable

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 03/26/2022 18:34:22
if it's the range finder that has issues, then try installing the latest nightly build from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

I believe there was a bug with that, but should not crash

if that doesn't solve it, I'll need to have a look at exactly what you do in your world/controller and whats in it, it's hard to say whats wrong with just this info if I'm unable to reproduce the problem

##### VRsE 03/26/2022 18:47:51

yo


anyone online?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2022 22:35:58
`@American Patriot` you have to set the correct environment variables


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers) refer to this documentation


restart your program

##### American Patriot 03/26/2022 22:51:18
do i need to reboot or can i just sign out and back in?


i did. signed in/out

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2022 22:51:37
or the console you launch the python file with

##### American Patriot 03/26/2022 22:52:19
and slight correction. im editing the file with vs code but i am not running it from there


i just need a handle to the webots framework. so i can do things like if (hardware is not type(controller.motor)) or something like that

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2022 22:54:33
you import the Controller package at the top of your file?

It would be useful to extract information from the environment more than used in a robot, so might be seen as a tool more than a sensor.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/31/2022 15:13:34
Sensor models in Webots should correspond to actual sensors. So, I don't it's a good idea to mix such a tool with a sensor model. I would rather implement a supervisor API function allowing to take a snapshot with an optional orthographic mode.

##### cnbarcelo 03/31/2022 15:15:05
That indeed feels like the right way to go. I'll create an issue and see if I can contribute with a proposal PR

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/31/2022 15:17:12
You may want to try the following idea : modify the Viewpoint parameters from a supervisor and take a snapshot. Not sure it will fulfill all your requirements though.

##### cnbarcelo 03/31/2022 15:19:34
Basically, what I want is a cut at a sensor level of the whole environment, so I wanna be able to play with the clipping planes too. I'm not sure if that will work tho, but will run some experiments and if it fells useful, I'll share the results

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/31/2022 15:19:44
You may need to add a couple of supervisor API functions to switch to orthographic mode and change the viewport resolution.

hi, if the robot is tumbling around, after toppling over while going over a hill/colliding with an object, what are the best physics parameters to change? I added a little bit of linear damping , and that seemed to help, but in general what other parameters should i change, if the general behavior seems unstable?

##### S4JJ4D 04/04/2022 09:20:29
the geometric structure of the robot is also important. for example, lowering the center of mass of the system improves lateral stability.


or for example, if your robot is "wide", it is harder to topple it


adding inertia helps too, if that's a viable option

Hi, I'm having some problems executing controllers for vehicles. Each time that the step function is executed, the simulation freezes. When I stop the execution at debug level (since I'm executing the controller as extern) the instruction executed is always the step function. why this is happening?

hi, i'm trying to make a robot for my engineering class and i'm having trouble with hinge joints. they always fall to gravity even if i explicitly apply force, torque, and/or velocity to them. i've also tried changing around the physics values, locking parts, etc.

sometimes i get it to move but it just bounces up and down, probably because it can't fully lift, or it lifts too much and spins out of control. any help would be appreciated.

Hello newbie at pretty much everything here.

I made a 170mm diameter circle with 4mm height in Fusion360. I tried exporting this design into an STL file to be imported into Webots via the "Import 3D Model". After importing the STL file, the object appears massive.



Is there a workaround for this?

ok so i'm still having issues with gravity. i've taken drake's advice and simplified my bounding objects to primitives but my motors still don't want to work


i got one to work by making the damping value really big until gravity didn't affect it and then using a big forec multiplier


the other one though just wants to swing around, if i do the damping trick then my robot destroys itself


it does work with gravity off though, i tried turning physics off for it and then it wouldn't move at all even if i applied force to it


i want the bucket on the end of the arms to rotate with a rotational motor

the entire robot works with gravity disabled. i can just disable it but i need it enabled as this is a group project and we need to test it going over bumpy surfaces


there's a second motor above each wheel that rotates the wheels around the Z axis


the robot is a theoretical robot we had to come up with. it doesn't have a real mass. i was using the default masses that came from the density values before but i set all the part masses to 1kg because the robot kept sinking into the floor


it is 12kg


here is my issue

Another question. The way I create custom proto files currently is by:

1. using the "Import 3D model" and importing the custom stl file I want to use,

2. Saving the world, open the wbt file and identify the part I want to use

3. Copy paste the part in a new file which I will save as .proto (by adding the corresponding proto definition)

4. Save it in the proto folder.



However when I do this (and added Physics), the objects even though they are rendered correctly, they seem to act like crazy, flying around in the scene. Does anyone know what causes this problem?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/14/2022 11:42:10

Ok I've gone in and added physics nodes to all solids with bounding objects. The robot still doesn't drop to the ground, and the wheels are now moving in a strange way. Not sure where I went wrong. (Also converted the wheels into solid nodes)

##### Reyk 04/19/2022 23:17:10
Hey, i'm currently struggling with the build in feature of differential wheels. As far as i understood: two hingejoints located on the same axle and anchors on this axle are automatically interpreted as differential wheel. This happens by default and leads to the problem that both wheels always turn with the same velocity. (As long as the velocity is set and not the position) For my project its essential to turn every wheel on its own even if all conditions for the differential wheel are fulfilled.

Now, my question is if there is a way to disable this feature for specific robots or worlds.

If the solution is already included in your documentation i'm sorry to bother you here. I did take a look in there and found nothing

##### MysticalFire 04/20/2022 02:31:54
Would it have anything to do with the code's `set_position` function executing `set_position(INFINITY)`?


Just set velocity?

I upgraded to 2022a, and i am using the compass get bearing formula given in the website. For the first photo where you can see the coord system of the bot, the bearing angle it gives is 90 degrees. In the second photo you can see the global coord system. In the third photo the compass angle it gives is 0.14 degrees. 

The compass coord system is aligned to the robot coord system, how is the value of the north vector so off like this? In the first photo, should it not be 0 degrees, since the x-axis of the robot points the same way as the global x axis

Thanks, I got it now. I was putting the bounding box too far down the tree, and couldn't translate it independently. For future reference:

Hinge joint

Solid <-Rotate this second solid to fit the bounding object you set above

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 04/21/2022 16:06:12
You should install it globally to your python Interpreter/Environment you are using. Webots will use the global python env (if not specified another one). May you can list all python libs and check if numpy is listed (default this works with `pip list` in a terminal, but i'm from Linux and not sure if these commands are os-indepent)


Then may check if the version of your default python env (where you just checked `pip list`) is the same like you have defined in the environment variable PYTHONPATH to link the specific webots python library. For example, if you have default 3.7 then the environment variable should also link to that library, otherwise it could be that you have numpy installed in your 3.7 python but webots tries to use 3.9 where its not?

##### Dr.SilentMetal 04/21/2022 16:21:06
Thanks so much `@Rico Schillings[Sweaty]`. The webots directory is set to the location I checked using `pip list`


I'm uninstalling all other version of python, leaving only the one that will be utilised, if that will help

Is there any way to access a node I spawned in the same controller?

Strange, getFromDef is returning None, and using getFromProtoDef raises an `AttributeError: 'Supervisor' object has no attribute 'getFromProtoDef'`

I've tried just dumping the object location to a file in the main supervisor loop (supervisor.step(settings.TIME\_STEP) ~= -1). The problem is that this loop hangs when the robot is moving, and so I'm not getting samples within that period.

Hello, I have a problem when simulating the epuck with the kinematic mode as True. With the kinematic mode set as true, the collision detection is not working and the epuck will cross walls. While as kinematic mode set as false, the wheels will detach from the robot. Do you have any idea what could be wrong?


And  I am converting a project from webots 2021a to 2022a. The code works well with kinematic ==True in webots 2021a, but started to have same problem as mentioned above with 2021b.

##### Wanting Jin 05/04/2022 13:24:20
In the sample world for epuck this is the obstacle avoidance behavior in the controller. If I replace the controller with our controller (no obstacle avoidance), it will cross the wall unfortunately

##### Wanting 05/04/2022 14:57:44
Okay thanks. Actually this behavior was already broken with 2021b


Okay. Thanks!! I will have a look


So a follow-up question for this. If we set the kinematic to false, is it normal that the wheel will detach from the robot after some time?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/04/2022 15:32:27
but if physics are involved, you need to also reset the physics of the robots in-between iterations otherwise the inertia will carry through

##### Wanting 05/04/2022 15:32:53
Yes, if you set the kinematic to false and run the controller with the fast speed for several minutes (it will happen after several iterations)


Okay. I see. Maybe it's true we need to reset the physics

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/04/2022 15:34:15
I see now, it takes some time to show. Yes, that's likely the culprit, you're resetting the positions of the robots but the angular velocities aren't

Hello! I originally opened the program with version 2019 on the robot simulator and it runs without any problem. However, when I run it on version 2022, I get the error "controller exited with status: 1. " What is the meaning of this error and how can I solve it?

##### AlexandrosNic 05/06/2022 13:20:59
hey, I know this question has been asked multiple times but I cannot get it running, when I run my custom package. The error is:

```
ImportError: usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38/_controller.so: undefined symbol: _ZN6webots5Robot19internalGetInstanceEv
```

I installed ROS2 and Webots following the installation guide (everything runs in a docker container), and I exported the envs as noted:

```
echo $WEBOTS_HOME
/usr/local/webots
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/opt/ros/foxy/opt/yaml_cpp_vendor/lib:/opt/ros/foxy/opt/rviz_ogre_vendor/lib:/opt/ros/foxy/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/opt/ros/foxy/lib:/usr/local/webots/lib/controller
echo $PYTHONPATH
/home/cocobots/cocobots_ws/install/cocobots_simu/lib/python3.8/site-packages:/opt/ros/foxy/lib/python3.8/site-packages:/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38
```

probably there is no error with my envs, since other examples such as these, are running:

```
ros2 launch webots_ros2_epuck robot_launch.py
ros2 launch webots_ros2_universal_robot multirobot_launch.py
```



UPDATE:

Fixed it from here [https://githubhot.com/repo/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/issues/420](https://githubhot.com/repo/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/issues/420)

Basically I replaced the 'Import Supervisor' with this:

```
import os
if os.getenv('ROS_DISTRO') is not None:
    from webots_ros2_driver_webots.controller import Supervisor
else:
    from controller import Supervisor

As for your other question, you should define a contact material for your wheel (parameter `contactMaterial`, calling it for ex: "wheel material")  and one for the solid that represents the spillage (calling it for ex: "oil material") and then you can add a `ContactProperties`  node under `WorldInfo > ContactProperties` between these two materials and configure the friction/... accordingly [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)

2. What are the environment variables? Shall I use /usr/local/webots or /mnt/c/Program Files/Webots for WEBOTS\_HOME etc

##### Kugelkopf 05/17/2022 21:06:14
Hello  everyone,

I would have a question regarding a bug or something weird in WSL 2 and Webots.

I have a Windows 10 21H2 and I'm using VcXserv to use GUI apps in my WSL 2 instance. Everything seems to be ok as I can run different GUI app,s Xcalc, Gedit, Gazeboo and also Webots. I would like to use Webots , but when I click in the middle of the screen where there is an object, the screen goes black. So I cannot click on the objects in the given webots scene or the whole screen goes black.



Does anybody has any idea of this issue? Or how this could be solved? Is it present on win 11, I can only use win 10 for now.

I also use GPU acceleration, here is my ~/.bashrch 



         source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

         export DISPLAY=$(ip route list default | awk '{print $3}'):0

         export LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_INDIRECT=0

If I use  export LIBGL\_ALWAYS\_SOFTWARE=1, the GPU acceleration is turned off, weird thing is the screen does not go black at that time. but the GPU usage remains at around 0-2%.



BUt When I try to Utilize the GPU, the issue happens.



Another weird thing is that glxgears shows a lot higher FPS with CPU only setting than when I use GPU acceleration as well:

around 730 FPS with only CPU

around 150 FPS with GPU acceeleration.



Shouldnt be this the other way around?

##### moebius 05/17/2022 22:40:01
Does the bounding box have to be an existing Shape in the scene tree or can we draw simple bounding boxes around existing shapes?

##### Kugelkopf 05/18/2022 05:48:41
If your question is in regards to mine. Just create a New scene, add an arena field then a Wood box. Click on them with your mouse and the screen should go black in the scene view.



You can however move around in the scene via the  mouse if you are not clicking on any objects,  just the empty space.


Also im interested if this only happens on win 10 21H1 with VcXsrv or this also happens on Win 11 latest build. (I dont have Access to win 11 at the moment)

Is there a known issue with point clouds and ROS in webots 2022a? I can't see anything in the issues.


I'm running webots 2022a, with ROS noetic and the included VelodynePuck proto on a Car


Using the provided ros\_automobile as the controller.


I can enable the sensor and the pointcloud using the ros service calls and the sensor turns on fine


range\_image looks correct and I get a sensor\_msgs/PointCloud2 topic with messages being published


*BUT* nothing can interpret the data in those messages


not rviz, rosshow, or if run a custom node and try and convert from the sensor\_msg to a pcl::PointCloud


the custom node is the most promising as at least it gives an error message rather than silently failing to do anything. the pcl::fromROSMsg function call errors with `Failed to find match for field 'x'.` for x, y, and z.


ok so looks like in the RosLidar.cpp file the `fields` and `point_step` fields just aren't getting set

Hello guys! Can robots in webots communicate with each other? Like knowing the position of each other. Any help would be great!

##### Benjamin Délèze [Cyberbotics] 06/10/2022 13:37:35
Hi,

A robot that is a Supervisor ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)) can retrieve other information about other robots.

Otherwise robots can communicate with each other through emitter ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)) and receiver ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver))

##### daz.quintal 06/12/2022 00:25:58
Hi, can someone please tell me if robot Nao can recognize objects? I read that the function wb\_robot\_has\_recognition tells you if it has recognition or not, and for the case of Nao the value it gives is 0, but is there any way to activate recognition on this robot?

Hi, I'm developing a custom plugin for communication between ROS2 and Webots. I'm using the webots\_ros2\_driver package for this purpose. Within the plugin I want to trigger a callback with a rate of 100Hz. I created a ROS2 wall timer  and set the use\_sim\_time parameter to true. Unfortunately, the timer is called only every 32ms instead of 10ms. Also, the /clock topic is published every 32ms. Does someone know the reason for this?

For me no longer blocking as I will finish my PR based on 2022b nightly with a simple environment, but if you want I can make an GH issue on the repo for the DJI world if this is handier for you?


reloading the world doesn't fix it btw

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/16/2022 13:46:11
It seems the windows nightly of R2022a is broken, we are investigating. For you specifically, yes you need R2022b anyway. One way of bypassing the dji issues is to download `assets-R2022b.zip` (from the same nightly) and extract it as explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure?version=develop&tab-os=windows#asset-cache-download](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure?version=develop&tab-os=windows#asset-cache-download)

this is my code ... plz confrm if there is any  mistake?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/29/2022 08:57:52
Ok sorry, I maybe misunderstood what you want.

You don't need to read the torque values in your controller  to enable the graph.

If you enable the torque feedback, it should work out of the box.

Did you try to enable it from the robot window directly by checking the graph check box?

Do you get any warning in the Webots console?


The graph shows the motor position (linear) or angle (rotational). If you control the motor in velocity the graph is disabled by default because the position is set to INFINITY.


Yes, you can modify the default robot window code and create your own and change the values that are displayed

##### áçè 06/29/2022 09:18:29

Hi, We're converting our files to work with R2022a, and we got everything working correctly again after using the scripts and quite a lot of manual work. But everything looks a bit off. I think the normal vectors of the shape files didn't get converted by the script. Any ideas how to fix that?

## July


Not really, but it looks weird and confusing. And I figured if there were a simple way I would prefer to fix it as well


A screenshot to explain. Notice how the rightmost pillar (which has it's own shape file) now has the light and dark sides completely different from the others, and how the orange robot on top has illuminated sides that doesn't match at all how the shadows are cast

And the update script only updated the coord part, so the normal vectors are probably all wrong


we might have some calibration boards that doesn't show up right in the cameras that cause some actual problems as well

I need to model a Coveyor Belt that has a closed loop geometry, I'm trying to understand how the ConveyorBelt.proto works. Then I came through these %< and %<= tags... it seems to work like an operator and a tag sometimes... can anyone help on this?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/04/2022 20:14:20
They are JavaScript scripting statements and allow to define the proto in a procedural way: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/javascript-procedural-proto](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/javascript-procedural-proto)

##### Darth Jon 07/04/2022 20:16:44
Yeah, I've read the proto documentation


I just thought it'd save me time if I used a simple coveyor proto as a template for my own. I'm just having a hard time understanding this specific proto as it seems to use a different kind of coding... I've found that %>% is an operator used to simplify the code, but in the ConveyorBelt.proto file it seems not to be the same operator...

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/04/2022 20:28:05
It's not an operator, anything between `%< ... >%` is pure JavaScript, anything between  `%<= ... >%` is JavaScript but evaluated (so `%<= abc >%` will be replaced by the value of abc)  and anything else is VRML

Hi everyone, I'm having issues when adding js script in my proto, it's like it doesn't recognize the header comment indicating javascript as the template language, and it looks for lua template statement opening. I'm getting this error

`error: Unexpected template statement opening. Expected='{', Received='<'.`


Do the protos have to comply with something in particular to be able to use js?


The header in my proto is

```#VRML_SIM R2022a utf8
\# template language: javascript
```

works for me, the cache is likely corrupted. In the same folder of the proto, look for a file called `.MyRobot.cache` and delete it


it's a hidden file

##### Naxi 07/12/2022 18:17:06
Yep, tried that too, weird. Well, at least the proto is syntax is correct


I'll look for that then, thanks


Indeed, copying the contents of the file to a new proto seems to solve the issue. Although there aren't any cached files in the original folder, I wnder what might be


For some reason, if the file extension is PROTO, it doesn't recognise js, but with lower case .proto it does

I have generated a sequence of control inputs over some time horizon from a motion planning algorithm. What would be the best way to pass into Webots and let the robot execute the controls at specific time instances?


I think the tricky part is ensure the robot control timestep and sim timestep are set  up correctly. The sim timestep is always less or equal to the control timestep. In my case, I have sim timestep = 32 and control timestep = 64. Then, the planner needs to spit out control sequence with 64ms in between.

Hey everyone!! 👋 



How do I turn 2 cubes into a 3rd cube in Webots?



I'm trying to simulate an assembly factory. In which, several robots gather the necessary parts (objects A & B) and drop them off on the assembly table. Once A & B are both on the assembly table, I want an event to trigger which converts A & B into a third object C. This event can either be automatic or triggered via keyboard input. Objects A & B should disappear and object C should spawn at a specific coordinate.



I currently have ground & arm robots which transports objects A & B to the assembly table, but that's all I have right now. The ground robot is remotely controlled (Webot's Khepera 1 TCP/IP model), so timing will always be different.



My main question: How do I remove objects A & B and spawn object C based on an event during simulation?



A side question: How can the assembly table automatically detect when both objects A & B are on the table?

Hello! Another Webots in the cloud question.



My end goal - Have a fully interactive Webots simulation that responds to external HTTP requests. The requests will be from different computers on the same local network. For example, I have a custom robot arm sequence for the Niryo Ned model which begins when `1` is pressed on the keyboard. I want to send an HTTP request to trigger the sequence instead of pressing `1`. 



I also have an Express server and React client set up for this project already. I'm using long polling to create a persistent connection between the server & client. The external HTTP request is sent to the Express server, and the React client automatically updates due to long polling.



I was thinking of embedding my Webots simulation in my React client, theoretically meaning I can trigger a Webots process when the event happens. I've been looking into Webots Web Server to do this ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-server?version=master](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-server?version=master)). I also noticed Webots.cloud ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/webots-cloud?version=master](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/webots-cloud?version=master))



It would look like this [https://webots.cloud/run?version=R2022b&url=https://github.com/ThomasOliverKimble/Theia\_Cloud/blob/master/thymio/worlds/thymio2.wbt](https://webots.cloud/run?version=R2022b&url=https://github.com/ThomasOliverKimble/Theia_Cloud/blob/master/thymio/worlds/thymio2.wbt) or this [https://webots.cloud/run?version=R2022b&url=https://github.com/ThomasOliverKimble/orobot/blob/main/worlds/OroBOT.wbt](https://webots.cloud/run?version=R2022b&url=https://github.com/ThomasOliverKimble/orobot/blob/main/worlds/OroBOT.wbt) but instead of GUI buttons/sliders controlling behavior, it would be handled in the background

Have you tried mesh shapes? We have been able to throw a lot of very complex stuff at it without issue


I would make a few different tiles of the ground where each tile contains the feature you want to test. They can be quite large or small as long as they are common sizes and so they tile well. You should be able to dynamically render the ground where you want and toggle movement and visibility to make it dynamic.

Hi 😃

I am currently trying to simulate driving a car (the standard Proto BMW X5) with the <setThrottle()> command.

Unfortunately, the vehicle does not move.

If I run the setCruisingSpeed everything is working fine.

Is there any additional setup or configuration that i missed? I could not find information on that on ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/driver-library?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/driver-library?tab-language=python))



Thanks in advance 😃 



(Webots version 2022a)


Yes, setgear worked,

Checked by calling getGear() which always returned the gear i set

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/02/2022 12:53:23
so it moves now?


this is a minimal python controller for the bmw, it works for me:

```
from vehicle import Driver

driver = Driver()

driver.setThrottle(1.0)
driver.setGear(1)

while driver.step() != -1:
    pass
```

##### PeecaPoo 08/02/2022 17:08:40
Hello Cyperbotics webmasters!

I hope you are well.



I have an issue with connecting between Webots software and Matlab. as the software keeps showing this warning

WARNING: Unable to find the 'matlab' executable in the current PATH.





I have attached a screenshot to help realize what I am talking about.





I hope you can help me ASAP.

##### NickMetalhead 08/05/2022 18:03:53
Hi guys. I have a problem with simulationReset(). I have a simple world using a modified Altino robot. I have added a camera and I also made it supervisor by modifing the .proto file.


I use a simple controller that commands a constant speed and angle. However, after I reset the simulation with simulationReset(), the angle of the wheels change, but the robot stays still. The controller is :

```
from vehicle import Driver

driver = Driver()

i = 0
while driver.step() != -1:
    i += 1
    if i % 100 == 0:
        driver.simulationReset()
        driver.simulationResetPhysics()
    driver.setCruisingSpeed(1.0)
    driver.setSteeringAngle(-1.0)

```

Hello @everyone 

I have been assigned to a project in college and I really stuck.

I hope you guys can help me out.



The project is simulating a navigation robot in Webots with VFH algorithm.



I only found one video on YouTube but no commentary or explanations there

here is the video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7njx41sGpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7njx41sGpo)



maybe one of you have an idea or have the project done already, who know.

##### JanSch99 08/09/2022 09:03:24
Hello,

I'm having some trouble with joint limits on the second part of a Hinge2Joint. I've reduced the problem to the following test world. Running the simulation shows that after the endpoint moves too far to the right (as seen in the video), both objects start moving unrealistically and uncontrollably, as if two constraints were fighting each other. I've already done lots of experiments (different limits, positions, damping, ...), but cannot get it to behave properly. The other axis (forwards/backwards as seen in the video) works properly, including the limits (omitted for brevity in the code below).

Hope someone can help, thanks in advance!

Specifying mass AND density makes no sense, density will be ignored in that case, so your object currently has a mass of only 1kg. Is that what you intended?

##### kano donn 08/27/2022 02:49:33
`@JohnR` yes it's possible. Are you new to webots?


Welcome! It's a fantastic tool. I think it should be able to do what you want. 



First I would recommend abstracting away your notion of a full drone. 



You need a shape that represents the primary drone, and a gripper of some kind. 



Your drone shape will need some feature that can represent the force generator of the fans. 



Have you found the wiki tutorials yet?

Ok. What is missing?

##### JohnR 08/27/2022 03:00:39
Im still researching but I am planning to simulate something like a rescue robot. Im just not sure how to go about it. So I guess my plan is to design the robot first.

##### kano donn 08/27/2022 03:21:08
Sweet concept! Have you built any robots yet?

##### JohnR 08/27/2022 03:21:59
Not yet. I I havent decided if its going to be a ground robot or aerial robot

##### kano donn 08/27/2022 03:27:16
Ok. So let's focus on getting a simple hello world not working. 



I would recommend a box with a single actuator and building the necessary control logic to move that first. Then we can get into more advanced multi actuator devices.

Hello,


I want to send a bunch of waypoints to the simulator and ask the mobile robot to follow each waypoints. The waypoints are generated from an external path planner (written in C++), what's the best way to pass in the value? And theoretically I want to read the robot's state in real time (current position, velocity, battery level etc.)


Is ROS the easiest option?

##### JohnR 08/31/2022 08:04:33
Sorry for the late reply. Busy with my other modules. But I assume you mean this C:\Users\My Computer\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\Scripts\

Can I use rospy and python controller in webots?

##### Florian 09/04/2022 10:32:54
Hey Mete. You just need to get the image? Maybe you should try opencv, worked for me.


Has someone experience with the distance sensor? I need to get the MinValue of the distance, but I'm always just getting the same: 0.0. Doesnt matter how far the distance to the wall is..


Thanks Daniel. Now I understand for what the lookup table is for 🙂


Mete if you´d like to use ros2 you should find everything important here: [https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Webots.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Webots.html)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/05/2022 14:13:18
You can use the supervisor powers to do what you'd do manually in a programmatic way. You need to get a reference to the translation field and set the value using `wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f` (or the ROS equivalent). Also I don't think the minimal value for `translationStep` is 0.01, it can be set lower (again either manually or using a supervisor)

Hey, I have a UR with a vacuum gripper. I use Connector node for the suction fuction of the gripper. This, requires that the objects to be grasped, have Physics node. However activating the physics causes the objects to jump around, or  not respect the tolerances when assembling objects together. I had to set the boundingObject same as the graphical representation, since I have to respect the objects' shape to assemble them together. Any idea how I can fix this?

##### urwah 09/08/2022 14:05:06
I want to simulate a robot injecting material(liquid chemical solution) into a 30mm hole in a 5m diameter disk. there are multiple holes. The robot should select hole then inject material into it through its pipe shaped end effector. The selection should be ideally according to the instruction given to it. Lets say i have like 20 holes , each numbered randomly. And its instructed  to go to instructed (by user) hole.

My idea was: to simulate the 5m circular plate in arduino, light leds on the numbered holes and then where it is lighted, the robot goes to that hole--> so light as means of instruction.. But idk if i can do this in webot. Can anybody guide me or give ideas or has suggestions? will be much appreciated.

Hello!



I'm having trouble opening Webots.



I'm not sure if this question is suitable for this channel, let alone allowed to be asked in this server, but I would like some help getting Webots working, or at least have an idea on why it isn't working.



I was able to download the right version (Windows) and I have read the Webots documentation on the system's requirements. I feel like I meet those requirements, but it still does not allow me to open the app. The app will show the loading screen, but then it would disappear and never load the actual program.



My laptop is a Windows, but my laptop is a little different from what I have heard as the brand of my laptop is a Samsung. However, I'm not sure if this is what is affecting my ability to open the program.



Please feel free to ping me or DM me, and let me know what you think! I would appreciate the help. 🙏

hey folks. I'm trying to implement a ROS2-Webots-Moveit2 application. After I deployed it, I figured out that is a bit buggy. To make sure, I tried the official webots ros2 driver: "ros2 launch webots\_ros2\_universal\_robot moveit\_demo\_launch.py" and I tested few **valid** target goals through rviz to check its accuracy. It succeeds on average 1/5 which makes it unreliable for my application. Sometimes it even fails when I use the "random valid goal state" of rviz. I would assume that this is moveit's issue, however when I test the same without webots (ur3e application), planning and executing works much better (4/5 successful). Does anyone have any idea what could be the culprit?

##### Benjamin Délèze [Cyberbotics] 09/16/2022 11:27:22
Never tried myself so I am not sure how they were done, but for the Nao, I saw that there is a software called `Choregraph` to make nao animation. You could try that and check if it is feasible to get motion file from there.

So how to fix this? Sorry Im still a beginner D:

The transformations node (tf) of ROS uses the PROTO frames for reference, instead of the urdf? My proto differs from the urdf since I had to add some links such as "world" and "table" in the urdf. The ROS's tf, generates a TF tree that combines the proto and the urdf frames, but since the proto frames does not exist in ROS, they are not recognized by tf. The result is a broken TF tree.  Why is this happening?


another question: how can I change the coordinate system of an object? I would like to set it in the centre of it (to be easier to manipulate the objects by extracting the position of their centre. I use .stl for the geometry of the objects (not IndexedFaceSet)

I open map of a contest and use C controller but nothing shows, only the sensor prints 0b00000000. The error is related to JavaScript although I use C controller. What's the problem and how to fix it :< Thank you so much

I created a .motion file from a .xar file created in Choregraphe (animation editor for Nao robot). 



`RotationalMotor: too low requested position: -74.5 < -1.54462`

It seems values for Joints are not transferable, is there any doc on the values used in Webots?

Hi folks. I'm getting this error when trying to get a controller running. Ubuntu 22.04, Webots R2022b

Yes all projects I open have the same error that releted to JavaScript

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/20/2022 14:54:47
I think other people had similar issues in the past, and even opening their projects on my machine I couldn't reproduce the issue. What fixed it for them was completely removing webots and reinstalling it

when I run a custom ROS controller on webots, even though the simulation runs fine, other ROS nodes don't seem to work. In particular I run 2 ROS nodes: one as webots controller to get the positions of the objects, and an action server for moveit. The action server then, never gets executed, but when I run it alone, it is executed. Any insights? 🙂


also if anyone has an example of using the latest UR drivers with webots and moveit on ros2 would be much appreciated. I run into many errors

##### Druthyn 09/20/2022 15:39:00
Is there any easy way to set a controller argument in a world file when using ros2 launch? eg passing a launch argument down to the desired controller?

##### Florian 09/21/2022 11:31:12
Hi there. Does someone knows how to use relative paths to images, that are in a ros2 workspace. The controller and world.wbt etc. is also in the ros2 workspace
