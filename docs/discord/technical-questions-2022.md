##### GeoCSBI 01/02/2022 14:45:37
Hey everyone and happy new year! I was working with MuliSense21 in an older version of Webots (2020 i believe). The range finder object could successfully retrieved according to the documentation, i.e., getDevice("Multisense21 meta range finder"). 



However in 2022a version, the Multisense21.proto missing the name field in the meta range finder object ->    

  RangeFinder {

        translation 0.05 0 0

        fieldOfView IS 

        cameraFieldOfView

        minRange 1.5

        maxRange IS 

        rangeFinderMaxRange

        width IS cameraWidth

        height IS cameraHeight

        noise IS rangeFinderNoise

      }



So it is not possible to get the object according documentation. Am I missing something?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/02/2022 15:04:18
You're right, it's a bug. For the time being you can retrieve the device called "range-finder" (after setting the `metaRangeFinder` field to `TRUE`), we'll fix it on the next nightly build.

##### GeoCSBI 01/02/2022 15:05:27
`@DDaniel` Thank you!

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:05:27
hello, I am quite new. I am trying to put some models from blender into a world, but when I add physics they are broken and fall in the floor or bounce around weirdly. What could be the issue?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:08:26
You use the original meshes for bounding objects?

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:08:40
yes

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:10:20
Try don't used it and make your bounding objects in webots, using simple shapes like boxes, cylinders, etc.

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:10:21

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:13:03
Check this example, you can see it, is very simple bounding objects. In this only 3 cylinders.

%end

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:13:55
Oh yeah, so weBots just cannot handle more complicated mesh very well?


and will make it unstable

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:15:05
Webots use the bounding objects to calculate the physics behavior,  if your bounding objects are more complex, the calculations is too


Other solution is set the basicTimeStep of the WoldInfo in low value


Maybe between 8 to 16

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:17:18
Okay, how can I create a group of bounding objects to represent a object with multiple parts?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:19:41
You can use a group node and put in children your shapes thru transform nodes, for you can move or rotate every part using transform nodes

##### tokia 01/04/2022 02:20:40
Okay I will try doing that, thank you for your help 😃

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 02:21:42
You welcome!


You can add more transform (step 2) in children Group of the bounding object

Excellent!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2022 07:46:37
The fix should be included in the latest nightly version available here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

You can get the device with `getDevice("MultiSense S21 meta range finder")`

##### Jan Weber 01/04/2022 13:39:50
Hello,

I have a problem with meshes and their appearance. When I create a Solid with a Box as geometry and for example RedBricks as appearance, everything works as expected: I get a box of red bricks.

However, when I use a Mesh as geometry, I get the correct geometry, but it is gray and the RedBrick texture is not visible.

Does anyone have any idea what could be the reason for this?

Here is my code:



Solid {

  children [

    Shape {

      # Does not work:

      geometry Mesh { url "walls.stl" }

      # But this works:

      # geometry Box { size 2 2 2 }

      appearance RedBricks{}

    }

  ]

}



Jan


That is the stl for my question

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2022 13:45:27
It is likely because the STL file format doesn't contain any texture coordinate information. Instead you should use the OBJ format and ensure your OBJ file does contain correct texture coordinates (you can add them using a 3D modeling software like Blender).

##### Max\_K 01/04/2022 15:06:50
hello i have a question about the coordinates system and transforms. The default setting of the coordinate system in the spot world and all other sample projects is NUE. Default should be ENU or? Anyway, I believe that ROS uses ENU. 

In webots I set the coordsystem to ENU and rotated the floor so that nothing falls. The transforms from the spot in webots point in the wrong direction and that's why I think it looks wrong in rviz.

Do I have to rotate all the transforms from the spot manually?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2022 15:08:01
In R2022a everything was converted to FLU/ENU

##### Max\_K 01/04/2022 15:11:36
is it possible to have 2021b and 2022a installed at the same time? I currently still have a "world" that does not run under 2022a.

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/04/2022 15:15:30
Hi! Maybe you need check this documentation [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/How-to-adapt-your-world-or-PROTO-to-Webots-R2022a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/How-to-adapt-your-world-or-PROTO-to-Webots-R2022a)

##### Max\_K 01/04/2022 15:21:05
Yes thanks maybe i try this script. But i think i first try the new version.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2022 15:22:55
On Linux, it is easy to install different versions (from the tarballs), on Windows or macOS, it is a bit more tricky as you will have to manually move files or rename folders to allow the installation of multiple versions.

##### Max\_K 01/04/2022 15:31:22
Ok thanks, I have ubuntu 20.04. I would try that then.

##### black\_hammer\_67 01/04/2022 20:21:14
Hello, I'm trying to setup an underwater scenario, do you have any idea for how to make floating objects on the water ? I already tried by changing the density of the object but it did not paid off.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2022 20:26:25
You also need to define the `immersionProperties` field of the Solids. You can look at the sample world: `file > open sample world > floating_geometries` as an example

##### black\_hammer\_67 01/04/2022 20:45:25
Ok, I'll check it out and I will return, thank.

##### weyho 01/05/2022 09:33:11
Hello,

currently I am getting a segfault, when i am trying to open my world build in 2021b with 2022a, is there anyway to recover my world and continue to use it in 2022a since I would like to stay up to date?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/05/2022 09:35:17
If you open the world with a text editor and replace the first line from `#VRML_SIM R2021b utf8` to `#VRML_SIM R2022a utf8`, does it still segfault?

##### Jan Weber 01/05/2022 13:36:24
Thanks for your quick reply! Now I understand the problem. Then I'll just make the walls monochrome for now.

##### weyho 01/05/2022 15:35:32
It does not segfault anymore, but my world is still not loading sadly

##### mcitir 01/05/2022 18:28:36
Hello, I want to apply some autonomous driving functions. So, I started to use webots. I am working on highway\_overtake tutorial. Do you know how I can extract or record point data cloud of lidars? I want to work on data set outside of webots. Also, I want to visualize point cloud data. But I am not familiar with ROS. Any idea how to possible recording with python script only?

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:15:16
Hello everyone,

I'm trying to simulate a hexapod. Like the "mantis" in the sample files. However, the design of my robot has a more complex structure and the robot fails. The warning from the console is as follows; "WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep." 

Can I give it a rectangular physics like in the "mantis" robot, without changing the robot's design? Or how can I give?


this is my robot geometry

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:22:31
Have you tried lowering the `basicTimeStep` of the simulation? That might solve it already. Otherwise it's usually not a good idea to use a complex mesh as `boundingObject`, in your case you can just use a `Box` node where the leg will contact with the ground

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:24:00
I tried lowering basicTimeStep but the error persisted


i guess i should use box geometry but i dont know how can i do it, when i add box in the geometry, the appearance is changing

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:26:02
you need to set in the `boundingObject` field of the yellow Solid, not geometry

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:27:35
the position of the box I added must be in the same position as the leg, right?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:28:11
You probably need to add a `Transform` node before the `Box` node in order to place it at the right spot

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:34:32
Should I add the transform inside children?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:35:57
```
boundingObject Transform {
  translation a b c
  children [
    Box {
      size x y z
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:43:40
I can't add box in children. What am i doing wrong?


there is no box in list

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2022 13:46:32
Should be possible. What about `Shape`? Can you add that before the `Box`?

##### Tyhe/Tyook 01/06/2022 13:47:01
oops, i find the problem, my mistake


I was trying to add in the wrong place

##### giunas97 01/09/2022 10:48:20
Hi, i'm using a kuka youbot and an e-puck in my project. But the youbot needs the contact properties defined in the WorldInfo node to work properly (for example, in my case, if these aren't defined, the youbot cannot reach the precise target point with the gps node). So, i entered the contact properties, now the youbot works properly, but the e-puck doesn't move straight. Any suggest to solve this problem? Thanks in advance


Not matter, solved. The problem was the basicTimestep

##### furkann 01/09/2022 16:54:32
hi guys


I have a question


are there any body here

##### Lavi 01/09/2022 17:26:52
Hi.

I'd like to add a stationary camera to my scene that does not move with my robot (arm). Trying to add a camera at the top level I get a message saying this is not possible.

If there some way to add a stationary camera?

##### shpigi 01/09/2022 17:49:59
I guess this is my answer:

[https://discordapp.com/channels/565154702715518986/565154703139405824/887352420110319656](https://discordapp.com/channels/565154702715518986/565154703139405824/887352420110319656)


I wish to control a ur10e arm and two stationary cameras with a single supervisor.

I tried nesting the arm and cameras in a single robot node as in the image below.



I can now get and enable the cameras within the supervisor `__init__` like so:

```
        self.st2_cam = self.getDevice("st2_cam")
        self.st2_cam.enable(self.timestep)
        self.st1_cam = self.getDevice("st1_cam")
        self.st1_cam.enable(self.timestep)
```

but I can not see the ur10 sensors. 

this:

```
        shoulder_pan_joint = self.getFromDef("ARM").getDevice("shoulder_pan_joint_sensor")
```

fails with `AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'getDevice'`



and this:

```
        shoulder_pan_joint = self.getDevice("shoulder_pan_joint_sensor")
```

returns None with a warning `Warning: "shoulder_pan_joint_sensor" device not found.`



Same for:

```
        shoulder_pan_joint = self.getDevice("ROBOT.ARM.shoulder_pan_joint_sensor")
```



How can I get both the arm and cams to work under the same supervisor?

##### [Red Dragons] Mat198 01/09/2022 21:42:23
I did something like this last week and had no problem using the IBR 4600. I wrote supervisor.getDevice("joint sensor name") if I remember correctly. I will check my code later


You need to call the motors first and then the sensors with the motors.



for link in armChain.links:

        if 'motor' in link.name:

            motor = supervisor.getDevice(link.name)

            motor.setVelocity(1.0)

            position\_sensor = motor.getPositionSensor()

            position\_sensor.enable(timeStep)

            motors.append(motor)

    return armChain, motors

##### shpigi 01/10/2022 17:00:26
Thanks `@[Red Dragons] Mat198` . In my case, doing `armChain = self.getFromDef("ARM")` returns a Node which does not have `links` so I'd need to investigate further. (Is it "OK" to nest a Robot under a Robot so that it shares the same thread as the cameras)?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/10/2022 17:21:48
In principle it is allowed to have a robot within a robot, but I don't believe access to the devices is shared among them. So each controller will only have access to its own devices.

If however the arm is defined as a proto, the reason you aren't able to get the node reference might be because this node is internal to the PROTO, hence it requires using `getFromProtoDef` method instead of `getFromDef`

##### shpigi 01/10/2022 17:28:43
Thanks `@DDaniel` . The arm is a UR10e, not something I myself imported from a PROTO file (so I guess it is not defined as a proto) 

Edit: or is it? [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/990e8291b3cb18c0709d984c8e4b72ebfbc7e641/projects/robots/universal\_robots/protos/UR10e.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/990e8291b3cb18c0709d984c8e4b72ebfbc7e641/projects/robots/universal_robots/protos/UR10e.proto)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/10/2022 17:32:00
If it's shipped with webots then indeed is defined as a PROTO


I don't know what you intend to do, but as a heads up internal nodes cannot be modified (not even with a supervisor). So if you intend to do something beyond just reading its position/state, you might want to convert it from a PROTO to a normal node (by right click and "convert to base node")

##### shpigi 01/10/2022 17:38:29
I did plan to `setPosition` and `setVelocity` on the motors

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/10/2022 17:42:47
That you can do from the arm's controller yes

##### shpigi 01/10/2022 17:44:24
can I do it from supervisor that runs on the robot that contains the UR10e as a child? (see the image in this post [https://discordapp.com/channels/565154702715518986/565154703139405824/929846569493229588](https://discordapp.com/channels/565154702715518986/565154703139405824/929846569493229588))


.. i.e. with this controller hierarchy

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/11/2022 00:59:28
you could convert the robot to basenodes (right click on it). Then Turn the Robot basenode into a transform. That should do the trick


This code-block shows you all devices, and this specifically puts all motors and position sensors in a list. But it prints ALL devices, so you can add other sensors.



> **Attachment**: [webots\_init\_devices.py](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/930266974196498472/webots_init_devices.py)


If you want to use an inverse kinematics controller I made (and which works very well), check out this repository. I have not checked it recently with the UR10e, but i did in the past and it worked flawlessly


[https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots\_pyikfast\_tutorial](https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots_pyikfast_tutorial)


I uploaded a solver for the ur10e I had lying around, but I have not tested building the module and testing it

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:15:31
I really appreciate it `@Luftwaffel` . Going to give all of it a try


so far, this code returns the two cams (`st1_cam` and `st2_cam`) but not the robot (converted from proto). I'm gueesing this is because it's a node, not a device and the getNumberOfDevices / getDeviceByIndex doesn't drill into the Nodes.

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:26:13
did you turn the robot node of the ur10e into a solid?


perhaps you can post another screenshot of your scene tree

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:27:31
I converted to Base Node and now this is my tree:

%end

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:28:45
create a new solid next to the 2 cameras. Then cut - copy all the ur10e's children to the solids children


perhaps also put the translation and rotation to the same values


then delete the "DEF ARM Robot" node


The issue is that you have nested Robot nodes. A robot is a node that starts a controller and has access to its own devices.


so you should only have your highest level robot node, if you want to control everything with one controller

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:37:22
`@Luftwaffel` , you're a genius! I went into a text editor, replaced the `DEF ARM Robot` with `Solid` and it worked!

This is your code's output:

```INFO: ur10_supervisor_manager: Starting controller: python -u ur10_supervisor_manager.py

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:38:00
😎  Awesome! that is a much smarter way to do it


If you want to get IK to work properly, I highly suggest you use my repository. I spent half a year with that stuff, and it is by far the best solution that is out there and compatible without complex other frameworks

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:40:31
Sounds great. Will do. I'm aiming at some reinforcement learning work and controlling the end-effector in Cartesian space (instead of doing actions in joint space) is very promising IMO

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/11/2022 01:41:16
then you kind of HAVE to use my repo. That was exactly what I was doing. I added support for cartesian velocity control without error drift


and it is very fast, in the dozens to hundreds of microseconds per solution instead of milliseconds


but dont expect too much from RL with robotic arms. Spend about 2 years with it

##### shpigi 01/11/2022 01:42:36
I'll be sure to let you know how it goes

##### Jan Weber 01/11/2022 11:21:28
Hello, is it possible to have a proto inherit from another proto? I want to extend the "TurtleBot3Burger.proto" with some sensors. So far I just copied it and made my changes in it (not in a field, but in children). But due to the change of the coordinate systems in R2022a I would now have to maintain different versions of the proto file for the different webots versions. Therefore it would be easier to let my modified proto inherit from the "official" proto and put only my changes there.

Or is the only way to do that via the extensionSlots?

Jan

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2022 11:34:12
You can inherit from another PROTO (just by nesting them, proto B calls proto A and providing some specific parameters to it). By doing it this way you can't however alter the base proto more than what it's exposed parameters allow for. However the extension slot was made for just that purpose, so you can put your sensors there

##### Jan Weber 01/12/2022 11:24:31
Thanks for the answer! I have now implemented it in the extensionSlot. However, with this I don't see any way to easily change a proto, like for example changing the lookup table from an already installed sensor. 

Anyway - my problem is solved, thank you!


I have another question: According to [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2022-a-release](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2022-a-release) webots\_ros2\_driver replaces the older webots\_ros2\_core. In the webots\_ros2\_core/launch/robot\_launch.py there was the possibility to specify the robot name so that the robot controller finds the associated robot in webots. I am missing this possibility in webots\_ros2\_driver.

I want to launch multiple external robot controllers from one ROS launchfile.

Also the possibility to work with environment variables (as described in [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)) fails in the context of ROS launchfiles, because the nodes are not started in a fixed time sequence.

The old way of specifying the robot name in the launchfile worked very well. Does anyone have an idea how to solve the problem?

##### Benjamin Hug [Cyberbotics] 01/12/2022 12:57:54
I suggest you to check this launch file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_universal\_robot/launch/multirobot\_launch.py#L40-L68](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_universal_robot/launch/multirobot_launch.py#L40-L68) which is what you are looking for.

##### Jan Weber 01/12/2022 15:17:37
Thank you, the "additional\_env" parameter worked.

##### moebius 01/12/2022 23:42:51
Hi I have a supervisor file that is generating the arena for the environment and managing running the sims for multiple robot designs , and I want to read some data from a json file for a given robot and pass those parameters to the customData field for the robot  using 

```
supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')
topLevelNodes.getMFNode(-1)
robot.getField('customData').setSFString(data['geometry_params'])
```

 but i do not see this reflected in the customData field in the GUI tree for the robot node, and hence I am not able to access the data in the controller file



What am i doing wrong, and how am i supposed to be passing the data to the controller?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/13/2022 07:32:13
Using the `customData` field this way should work. Are you sure you are pointing to the right robot? Can you for example change the `description` field for that robot and see the change in the scene tree? Alternatively, you may also use an `Emitter` on the supervisor side and a `Receiver` device on the robot side.

##### pyphais 01/13/2022 08:09:15
Hi all, I'm trying to make a skid-steer vehicle simulation accurate to the physical vehicle I have. I've set it up so that the available torque for each wheel at each step is based on the speed of the wheel, and approximated a linear torque-speed curve, then I attempt to set the velocity for each wheel and it uses the available torque to do it. I figured this is more accurate than simply picking an acceleration as the motors do not have that information. The vehicle seems to be getting to the correct speed doing this (its max speed is dependent on the torque available at that speed), but it is accelerating much too quickly. The physical vehicle takes about 1/4 of the wheel to get up to speed, and another quarter turn of the wheel to come to a complete stop when the throttle is let go, but the simulated vehicle seems to do both nearly instantaneously. Lowering the available torque just lowers the max speed that the vehicle gets to instead of affecting the accelerations, increasing friction makes it worse, decreasing friction makes it slide instead of continuing turning the wheel. I'm not sure what parameters to edit in order to make it have the same behavior as the real vehicle. The only thing that gets me that behavior is increasing the mass of the wheels from 0.7kg to like 50kg each, but this is definitely not the case for the real vehicle. Does anyone have any advice?

##### moebius 01/13/2022 08:09:49
yes I'm pointing to the right robot, but  i'll check once more. I'll try the methods that you've mentioned and get back to you, thanks you so much!

When I used webots to simulate led lights, I used the following code:

from controller import Robot

from controller import LED



robot = Robot()

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

led = robot.getDevice("led")

print(led)

print(led.get())

led.set(1)

print(led.get())

while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    led.set(1)

    pass



But unfortunately, my led doesn't light up, and I don't know why (console output is fine). Hope someone can help me! THANKS!!!

That's a code to get webots images and send them to openCV:



from controller import Robot

from controller import Camera

import cv2 

import numpy as np





\# create the Robot instance.

robot = Robot()



\# get the time step of the current world.

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())



\# Get camera devices

cam\_right = robot.getDevice('cam\_right')

cam\_left = robot.getDevice('cam\_left')





\#Enable the cameras

Camera.enable(cam\_right, timestep)

Camera.enable(cam\_left, timestep)



\# Get camera parameters

width = cam\_right.getWidth()

height = cam\_right.getHeight()

fov = cam\_right.getFov() 



cv2.startWindowThread()



while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    

    # Read the sensors:

    img\_right = cam\_right.getImage()

    img\_left = cam\_left.getImage()

    

    # Convert images to openCV

    img\_right\_cv = np.frombuffer(img\_right, np.uint8).reshape((height, width, 4))

    img\_left\_cv = np.frombuffer(img\_left, np.uint8).reshape((height, width, 4))

    

    # Showing images

    cv2.imshow("Direita",img\_right\_cv)

    cv2.imshow('Esquerda',img\_left\_cv)

    cv2.waitKey(timestep)

\# Enter here exit cleanup code.

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/16/2022 21:59:39
Hi, you need put a pointlight or spotlight in children LED node and define the color that you need. 



This is an example in Python:



\# Initialize LED

led = robot.getDevice('led\_name')



\# Turn on LED

led.set(1)

   

\# Turn off LED

led.set(0)



Reference: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/led](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/led)


You must be use pointlight with castShadows setting in TRUE to obtain more realistic results. 



Check the world samples, in devices a LED example to understand that I say

I will need to see your launch file in order to help you, hard to say without any code. You might check some of our tutorials if you begin with Webots ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Tutorials](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Tutorials)).

The error does not occur when I revert back to Webots R2021b and the issue shows up for the deb as well as the tar package of Webots 2022a. Does anyone know what may be causing this?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/17/2022 16:17:08
When installing from tar, did you follow these steps? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installing-the-tarball-package](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installing-the-tarball-package)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/17/2022 16:18:38
`GPS.getSpeedVector` is a new API function in Webots R2022a. Are you sure, you don't have two versions of Webots installed on your machine and `WEBOTS_HOME` is pointing to R2021b while you are try to run R2022a?

No need to open an issue, it should be fixed already. The corrected version should become available with tonight's nightly build here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

##### Jan Weber 01/21/2022 14:12:42
I am currently converting my project from the old webots\_ros2\_core to the webots\_ros2\_driver. I am using webots\_ros2\_turtlebot. I noticed that the tf2-tree of the turtlebot is not connected: (see tf2\_tree\_splitted.png)

In webots 2021a with webots\_ros2\_core it was fully connected. 

My understanding is that the tree should be completely built by the driver, right? I have now extended the robot\_launch.py from webots\_ros2\_turtlebot:



    extension\_slot\_publisher = Node(

        package='tf2\_ros',

        executable='static\_transform\_publisher',

        output='screen',

        arguments=['-0.03', '0', '0.153', '0', '0', '0', 'base\_link', 'extension\_slot'],

    )



    lidar\_publisher = Node(

        package='tf2\_ros',

        executable='static\_transform\_publisher',

        output='screen',

        arguments=['0', '0', '0.02', '0', '0', 'extension\_slot', 'LDS-01'],

    )



Now the tree is fully connected and the navigation works: (see tf2\_tree.png)



I am unsure if this is the right way. I rarely get this warning, which to my understanding indicates that someone is publishing the transformation between LDS-01 and base\_link:



[controller\_server-11] [INFO] [1642773577.942406284] [local\_costmap.local\_costmap\_rclcpp\_node]: Message Filter dropping message: frame 'LDS-01' at time 0.864 for reason 'the timestamp on the message is earlier than all the data in the transform cache'.

When I run  `ros2 launch webots_ros2_turtlebot robot_launch.py` I have this tree, so I guess you are missing something.

Maybe by looking here ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_turtlebot/launch/robot\_launch.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_turtlebot/launch/robot_launch.py)) you will find out what is wrong / missing, otherwise I think it would be easier to open an issue on `webots_ros2` so we can take a look more in depth.

Hello, i try to add a TouchSensor to the spot robot. I followed the tutorial setting-up a Robot Simulation. I am able to add a Distance Sensor as described in updating my\_robot.urdf and had the ros topic also available. But when i try to add a TouchSensor i get the error:

```[driver-2] wb_device_init(): node not handled

##### Benjamin Hug [Cyberbotics] 01/21/2022 16:35:29
Webots tries to init the TouchSensor with `wb_device_init`, but it shouldn't.



In any case, the TouchSensor is not yet implemented in the ROS 2 interface for Webots :/

But it is on our to do list!

##### kindleforjc 01/21/2022 21:49:33
Hello all, just started with Webots Automotive and python. I am trying to make small example where car can reach up to some solid node.



I am trying to use the supervisor API in  python but it says "Only one instance of the Root class should be created".



So can anyone help me understand the error? Does this mean that when we add any Car/Vehicle and set the Supervisor field to True... In background one instance of that robot is already created?



Is there any way to access the self instance in python for vehicle?



Thank you and sorry if my questions are not clear.


I think I got it. I had created Driver() instance already and hence no need to create Supervisor () instance. 



Thank you.

That error is from the physics engine, I think something is very wrong with your version, something might have been corrupted. I suggest you try to completely uninstall webots and reinstall it

##### giaco\_mz 01/22/2022 19:06:18
ok, one question can you give me some advice to speed up this kind of simulation please?


from webots settings point of view

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/22/2022 19:15:10
these simulations are meant to be very realistic, so they are especially heavy. If you don't need that much, disabling `backlash` modeling would help (set the corresponding flag to false), and disable `turfPhysics` for the ground. Disabling rendering also helps, but there's not much else you can do, it depends a lot on your system too

Ok, i have an instance of my robot, but i cant execute supervisor functions. I want to use getFromDef to access a boundingObject Group that i could use to detect the collision.

I have the same error as here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/4134](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/4134)



I exported the env vars, but the error remains

##### Benjamin Hug [Cyberbotics] 01/25/2022 13:08:13
Please open an issue on Github so we can look at this together more in depth.

I opened an issue.

##### moebius 01/26/2022 03:47:32
if a .wbo file i am importing into webots has the coordinate system with the x axis pointing up and the arena has the coordinate system with the y axis pointing up (a +90 deg rotation about the z axis basically) , is there anyway I can change the coordinate systems of either of them so they match? I need to use a compass and the values are obviously not usable at the moment. Or should I do some transformation in the controller itself to use the compass values? would really appreciate the help, i am a bit stuck here.

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/26/2022 09:57:47
I'm trying to rebuild a RC-car in webots which we are using for several university projects to test self-driving algorithms. Its a Audi q2 scaled with 1:8 (see picture). I am using the Car.proto to allow working with the webots driver library, but when i down-scaled everything with the real dimensions of our car, I have the following problem: Using 4x4 is working but it seems that the car is "slipping" over the front wheels as soon as I steer into a curve (like the friction of the front wheels is to low and the rear wheels are pushing the car ahead instead of steering correctly..). Since our real car has only a rear motor, I would like to use the "propulsion" type of car.proto. But this is not working for such small-scaled cars like I want. With propulsion the front tires are blocking/fixed and do not rotate. 



I also tested the example proto of the saeon altino car. This is by default a 4x4 type, but when I change it to propulsion, its front wheels are also blocking. 



Could it be that there is a kind of a bug with the car.proto which only work for (nearly) realistic dimensions but not when working with small-scaled cars?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2022 09:59:38
Are you using the `scale` parameter to scale it down? This scaling should only be used on geometries, not at the robot level

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/26/2022 10:02:58
No I just use `scale` on my created mesh/stl files. I have measured all dimensions from the real car and modified the values in the car.proto (e.g. `trackFront = 0.2` or `wheelbase=0.36`) and also created a new wheel.proto with measured values

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2022 15:42:38
Maybe you need also to adapt some other parameters, like the various spring constants, torques, break coefficients, etc.?

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/26/2022 15:56:20
Well, this could be since I dont have adapt all of them. But 1. For some values I dont know exactly what plausible values would be (some are unitless so i dont know the plausible range or on what they depend) and 2. This would Not explain, why the saeon altino have the same Problem when changing from 4x4 to propulsion. I think the other parameters of the altino should be adapted well for the mini car?

I just tried that and it worked fine for me. The only difference is that my `PYTHONPATH` contains only `/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38`. Could you also check your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` environment variables?


Even after I typed `source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash`, `PYTHONPATH` is changed to `/opt/ros/galactic/lib/python3.8/site-packages:/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38` and everything works as expected. So, there is apparently not conflict with `galactic`.

##### Timple 01/27/2022 08:52:00
Interesting. Colleagues have the same issue. I'll report back later today on your suggestion

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/27/2022 11:47:14
Ok I've tested a lot with different parameters and you're right. After decreasing the wheelDampingConstant to a very low value it seems to work with propulsion. Nevertheless I still have to find more realistic values for those parameters 🙂 Maybe I write a simple genetic optimizer for this 😉 Thanks for your hint to check them

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/27/2022 11:48:16
Let me know whatever you find. It would be nice to be able to document it somehow.

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 01/27/2022 11:51:58
Alright. Since we want to try to use webots for further autonomous plattforms at our university I will optimize them further. As soon as its accurate enough I will also start to use webots to test several learning algorithms to evaluate if we can use it for transfer learning progress (sim2real) 🙂

##### amna 01/28/2022 08:05:00
ok great!


What values shall i give to trajectory, speed and step in human.py?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/28/2022 08:33:55
what is human.py? your own controller? normally you need .BVH files that define the animation the character will play

##### amna 01/28/2022 08:45:48
`@DDaniel` Yes, it is a controller of pedestrian.


It is in python and documentation says to add values of trajectory, speed and step to make the pedestrian move

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/28/2022 08:55:02
pedestrian is a different thing, a sample of that is also available (`file > open sample world > humans > pedestrian`). If you use the pedestrian.py controller you need to specify in the `controllerArgs` field these properties, `--trajectory` specifies the path the human will take, `--speed` the speed it should run at and `--step` the timestep. If you look at that example it should be fairly clear

Hello everyone

I am working on a prosthesis project. Therefore, I would like to have a human model, maybe a CharacterSkin (simulated using .bvh files), "cut" its leg, and replace it with our prosthesis model.

Is that even possible in Webots? And any idea on how to do so?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/01/2022 17:51:09
.bvh defines an animation, there's no physics involved. For a physically driven simulation you need to specify the solids corresponding to the bones (and joints)

##### ToKi 02/01/2022 21:06:34
Hey there,

so I have this older Webots-project for demonstrating line follower robots for a course I'm holding. The model is based on the e-puck model with a normal "infra-red" type sensor set in the groundSensorsSlot. I use a black and white png set as the baseColorMap under RectangleArena/floorAppearance PBRAppearance as the track to follow. I previously had a R2020-version of Webots installed, where the model was still working. Since the students will most likely use the newest version, I today also upgraded to R2022a. Otherwise the model opens and runs fine, but the irSensor now delivers a constant value (1000 with the standard lookup table) Does anyone have any pointers, what might have happened in the last couple of versions? Is there some setting I need to tweak to get it working again? I couldn't find anything directly helpful in the release notes nor online, and playing aroud with the parameters didn't seem to do much either. Thanks!

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/02/2022 16:40:48
Hey. As already mentioned I'm working with the car library to simulate our RC cars. As a next step i want to use our DRL framework to start learning. Therefore i would need some supervisor functions (e.g. reset simulation or groundtruth information..) currently i have implemented my own ros2 node which also acts as external webots controller with the car library. As Ive seen `car` seems to be the "Supervisor" of the `driver` but it has no real supervisor access. My question is: what would be the "nicest" solution? Define my car proto as supervisor and do a internal typecast on the supervisor node to also have access to the car/driver library OR add a separate Supervisor robot to my world as supervisor? In the last case i would have 2 external controllers since I also would like to use ros2 for the supervisor functions🤨

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/02/2022 17:12:03
The Car class inherits from the Supervisor class so you have all powers with a Car instance. If you rely on the Car.proto for your model, then you might need to set the Supervisor flag to true

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/02/2022 17:39:56
oh dear, shame on me... I rely on the Car.proto but forgot to add the supervisor field to it so I was unable to test it before i asked my (stupid) question.. Now it works fine and I have all supervisor power like I need. Thanks for this hint 🙂

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 02/03/2022 08:16:52
You can use in c :

In python is similar:

timeX =  robot.getTime()  #  obtain the run time simulation



You can combine with supervisor node to stop the run simulation, for example

I have another question. Is there some kind of function to get the lanes of a roadsegment? I want to check on which lane of the road the car is driving and just ask if there already exist some functionality for this case or I should implement it from scratch by getting the fields and calculate it manually? 🙂

##### 안정수 02/04/2022 12:24:27
I also tried implementing my own. However, when I visualize my vehicle in Rviz, the PointCloud data is not visible due to the TF problem.

Answer to your additional question: I'm not sure of the answer because I'm experimenting in a field environment. Sorry for not giving you an answer.

You can have a look to this code, it notably purposes to move the mavic to specific coordinates: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-projects/blob/master/projects/forest\_firefighters/controllers/autonomous\_mavic/autonomous\_mavic.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-projects/blob/master/projects/forest_firefighters/controllers/autonomous_mavic/autonomous_mavic.py)

##### Benjamin Hug [Cyberbotics] 02/04/2022 14:27:22
Do you mean that you stated `--robot-description` in the controllerArgs of the robot in Webots, and that your `robot_state_publisher` node does not publish although you started it ?

##### 안정수 02/04/2022 16:18:49
Yes, this option is used in the wbt file and TF is not generated properly when robot\_state\_publisher is executed.

##### Benjamin Hug [Cyberbotics] 02/04/2022 16:24:19
Can you see if robot\_state\_publisher receive an urdf as parameter?


In case it doesn't receive the urdf, could you open on issue on [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros/issues](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros/issues) and, if possible, upload your world so I can take a look?

##### 안정수 02/04/2022 16:28:16

Hi, how could I fix a solid to the ground?

The closest thing I can imagine is adding some joint as a children to the Solid that is that cylinder, and for its endpoint, defining a SolidReference with a value of "<static environment>". But the problem is that the joints I know how to use (Hinge and Slider) would give a degree of freedom that I don't want.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/06/2022 09:25:15
If the uppermost solid doesn't have physics enabled, it will be fixed to the environment, so either remove physics from the cylinder or add an upper solid without physics. If it's a robot the same applies

Perfect I will investigate that in the next days.

##### mclzc 02/06/2022 15:56:05
Thank you very much.


Is it possible to force a body to have a velocity in certain direction and then read the torque values of attached motors? 

I have a mechanism and want to know the input torque profile that would be needed to obtain certain motion in the other end of the mechanism.


My Webots was crashing; it was stuck thinking that it needed to run void.exe as a controller, even though in my world there is no supervisor==True nor controller "something" defined anymore.

It is related to my usage of SolidReference and "<static environment>", which I tried using because removing the physics node wasn't working anymore to fix a body for some reason (that's a different story).

Removing the SolidReference fixes the issue, but I still wonder why was it crashing in that way.

I'm trying to create several tracks with RoadSegments. When I add these in the world-file I can access the fields of each segment without problems (`getFromDef("ROAD1").getField("length").getSFFloat()`) But to keep my world file clean and make several track files, I introduced a new proto were I have some fields to re-use (e.g. `width/ lines`)  for all road segments and just list the roadSegments in a Group node (also with DEF). But when I try to access the fields of the grouped segments (`getFromDef("TRACK").getFromProtoDef("ROAD1").getField("length")...` I get invalid values for the fields of these segments. Is there a kind of access limitation?

hello I am trying to control the spot via ros2 with teleop. I have ported parts of the SoftServe repo: [https://github.com/SoftServeSAG/robotics\_spot/blob/temp\_robomaker/robot\_ws/src/rs\_inverse/scripts/SpotKinematics.py](https://github.com/SoftServeSAG/robotics_spot/blob/temp_robomaker/robot_ws/src/rs_inverse/scripts/SpotKinematics.py)

 

There is a SpotModel class which are initialized with parameters for the legs. As comment it says "Spot Micro Kinematics". 

Is the Spot in webots the "Micro" version or another one?

I don't know if these values are correct:

``` shoulder_length=0.110945,
elbow_length=0.3205,
wrist_length=0.37,
hip_x=2*0.29785,
hip_y=2*0.055,
foot_x=2*0.29785,
foot_y=2*0.2,
height=0.6,
com_offset=0.016,
shoulder_lim=[-0.78539816339744827899, 0.78539816339744827899],
elbow_lim=[-0.89884456477707963539, 2.2951079663725435509],
wrist\_lim=[-2.7929, -0.254801]
```



For the \_lim parameters, I have so far only specified the min/max position of the 3 motors.

The rest of the values I should be able to look up in the "spot.proto" or?

Hi, I'm not having luck fixing the endpoint of a slider joint. I'm trying for the endpoint to have a solid without a physics node, but the solid isn't being fixed.

I have:

`Robot (the beam) with physics and boundingObject -> HingeJoint -> Solid with physics (blue cylinder) -> SliderJoint -> Solid without physics (white cylinder)`

The blue cylinder seems to be attached to the white cylinder and dragging it down when the simulation starts.

Any ideas please?

Hello, I see some points to review:

The orientation of the axis must be configured depending on the movement required. 

Maybe the correct orientation is vertical.

The boundingObject must be included if physics is included

Thank you for having reviewed it `@DrakerDG` . 

- The axis that you mention is a hinge joint that I want. You may be thinking that such axis is the one of the SliderJoint, but that one is in the correct orientation, just hidden behind the shape.

- I've added the Shape of the blue cylinder as a BoundingObject, but found no difference in the results: the blue cylinder still drags down the white cylinder.

I see that you started the model using the white cylinder as the base Robot node. It works but I still wonder if starting from the read beam would work somehow. Starting the modelling from the center read beam would be better because all the joints would descend from it, and would be easier to manage. Having the Robot node in the start or last element would create a huge tree underneath it.

The spot model in Webots corresponds to the real one from Boston Dynamics, not the "Micro" version. You should indeed look inside the Spot.proto file to get the values you need.

(For context: I'm calling it like this:

  exit()

```  i have checked that it's not just running  `exit()` and even when i call it in a `print` it just restarts)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/09/2022 15:39:58

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 02/12/2022 04:45:22
You need initialize the accelerometer and enable this first:



\# Initialize and enable accelerometer

accel = robot.getDevice('accelerometer')

accel.enable(time\_step)


`@Rico Schillings[Sweaty]`  is right, to get the values you need write this:



acceldata = accel.getValues()


\#acceldata is  a vector with x y z values


You can obtain the unique value using trigonometry:

You should be able to ask a Lidar to publish a PointCloud message in ROS by using a service ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/24050b50b9d1b67799fd40d2fbf127e899a9e749/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosLidar.cpp#L25](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/24050b50b9d1b67799fd40d2fbf127e899a9e749/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosLidar.cpp#L25)).

Hello, I have a question about the automation of the world change and save. Is there a way to force a world save after the simulation is launched? Indeed the WorldSave function returns an error.

```
The simulation has run!
Saving the .wbt file will store the current world state: the objects position and rotation and other fields may differ from the original file!
Do you want to save this modified world?
```

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/15/2022 14:19:17
If you mean manually using the save button, that's just a warning which you can ignore. The warning is there because more often than not you don't want to save an already started simulation, but there might be situations where you might want to. If you mean saving the world from the controller/supervisor, then you can use the appropriate function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_world\_save](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_world_save)

##### wesllo 02/15/2022 14:26:11
thanks <@787796043987025941>. 

Yes, I'm talking about the use of the supervisor's wb\_supervisor\_world\_save function, I need to save even after the simulation has been run, but "The boolean return value indicates the success of the save operation." and the result is always wrong due to the simulation being run.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/15/2022 14:37:33
I've tested and I don't have any issue with it, I can save after the simulation has run without problems. Which version are you using? and which programming language?

##### Venkat 02/15/2022 16:12:31
I am trying to use extern controller on the robot(s) I have. The robot is mounted on a linear axis which traverses on one axis. The linear axis is modeled as a robot, so it has its own controller. For the linear axis motion , I use a sliderjoint with "LinearMotor" and "PositionSensor" devices. The structure looks like: LinearAxisRobot (LinearAxisController) -> children -> sliderjoint (LinearMotor and PositionSensor) ->  children -> UR10Robot.. I am trying with "extern" controller for both the robots to have sequential control. URRobot controller works fine with extern controller, that the joints move as expected. But linear axis controller isnt workin properly (from extern controller). The error is "AttributeError : Nonetype object has no attribute 'enable' " (for the position sensor). Is there any way to handle this problem.

Thanks,

Venkatachalam

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/15/2022 16:15:28
A proto file containing javascript template statements is executed and therefore converted to pure VRML before the world is run. If after the load of this PROTO you change one of its parameters (using for instance a supervisor) and this change triggers a regeneration of the PROTO, this occurs automatically. Can you show an example of what you're trying to do?


As far as I understood you have a Robot within a Robot, right? If so, the controller of each robot can only access its own devices, not those of the other robot

##### Jan Weber 02/15/2022 16:45:49
I wrote a javascript function that changes positions of joints when the translation of the robot changes. What I understand after your answer is that with each change the proto is regenerated. And this takes about 0.5s. So my simulation becomes very slow...

So my approach is not useful. I will continue to do it with a supervisor for now.

Since I have to change many joint positions of the robot with the supervisor (with setSFFloat or setMFFloat), my simulation is also slowed down. Is there a way to set multiple values, e.g. an array with a single set command?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/15/2022 16:49:08
I assume you only need to change the positions once and then you let the motors/controller do the rest right? If so, for this initialization of the joints you can use [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_set\_joint\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_set_joint_position), which is a more proper approach rather than getting the field references and changing them yourself


but it still requires calling this function for each joint you wish to set a position

##### Jan Weber 02/15/2022 17:21:50
My "robot" is the Pedestrian Model. This has no motors. Since I want to simulate many pedestrians (e.g. 100) and each has 14 joints, I have 1400 setSFFloat() calls per time step. I would like to reduce the overhead from the many individual function calls. According to my measurements, setSFVec3f takes a similar amount of time as setSFFloat, so I suspect that the many individual calls have a large overhead.

##### Venkat 02/15/2022 18:37:14
Yes, I understand that and it works when executed with local controller. The problem is to use extern controller.. 1. since there are more robots in the environment, I am unable to create "Robot()" instance for each robot locally (in local controller). So, I created this instance from the external program and pass this as parameter to the class to instantiate... For the UR10robot, this works fine but not for the Sliderjoint.. I am getting the problem when I try to access "Position Sensors" and their values. I had to change the program to "enable" the position sensors from the method where it is used and not in the class (for UR10 robot and Sliderjoint). For UR10 it is working fine and not for Sliderjoint..

##### Venkat 02/16/2022 08:33:14
Yes, I understand that and it works when executed with local controller.  As in the attached figure, I made the sliderjoint and had a connector as the "endPoint" to the slider joint. To the children of the slider joint is the UR10e robot attached. With this I tried, invoking the controller from "extern" python program. The problem is to use extern controller.. since there are more robots in the environment, I am unable to create "Robot()" instance for each robot locally (in local controller, it threw an error that there could only one robot instance created). So, I created this instance from the external program and pass this as parameter to the class to instantiate... For the UR10robot, this works fine but not for the Sliderjoint.. I got the problem when I try to access "Position Sensors" and their values. I had to change the program to "enable" the position sensors from the method (inside function of the class) where it is used and not in the class (for UR10 robot and Sliderjoint). For UR10 it is working fine and not for Sliderjoint.. But accessing the "device" motor of the slider joint is still throwing a warning that the devices are not found. In the simulation, the robot itself is not moving. 

I would like to know, if we can have a robot with slider joint and write a controller for it. I had this working for local controller.



~~Also I see now that, when I execute the external python program for only the linear axis, I am getting the following warning: "Failed to attach extern robot controller: no available "<extern> robot controller named "UR10e" found." I made the UR10e controller to be "void" and use extern controller only on the linear axis. I am getting this message when I do so.~~ This problem is due to environment variable error. I would like to solve the problem for error on "Only one instance of robot class should be defined".

Did you try to give a DEF name to your vehicle in the form of : `SUMO_VEHICLE0` ?


Basically what you did was: `Robot { GPS { Solid { Shape {}}}`, however all devices, GPS included, are already solids themselves so you can put the shape directly in the children field of the GPS. The reason it falls off is because for the Robot and Solid nodes you added a Physics node, but you didn't for the GPS. In summary, to fix your issue and simplify your design you need to move the shape into the children field of the GPS and move the Physics node you defined in the Solid to the GPS itself.

##### moebius 02/18/2022 21:15:43

      rotation    # use this to orient it

is it possible to draw 3d lines in the world using physics plugins?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/19/2022 13:38:19
World files are defined using VRML syntax, which is quite straightforward. If you ever created a PROTO yourself, it's virtually the same thing. All you really need is the official documentation  (like this: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#camera)) to know what are the fields of the nodes and based on the type of field (SFBool, SFFloat, ...) , you'll need to learn what is the correct the syntax. Try opening a simple world with a text editor and it should be fairly simple to learn it.


Not with the Physics plugin directly, but you can send the necessary information from the physics plugin to a supervisor with `dWebotsSend` ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend)) and let the supervisor do the drawing. For instance in the sample worlds: `file > open sample worlds > supervisor_draw_trail.wbt` is shown how to draw a path

I don't think that's the right approach, if you want to create worlds in a programmatic way, the best approach is to use a supervisor to spawn objects into the world, using functions such as: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string). This tutorial goes through this approach: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-8-the-supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-8-the-supervisor)

Can you share your world to take a look it?

I have a probably stupid question but here we go

If you had to make a game that allows the user to improve their drone flying skills would webots be suitable for that or would I be better of using a traditional gameengine (unity or the likes)?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 02/21/2022 18:30:53
It is possible in webots, but I think that it will be better or easier using some game engine

##### Pahanda 02/21/2022 18:48:14
ok, thank you very much for the answer

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 02/21/2022 18:56:14
`@Pahanda` you welcome 👍

Hi, is it possible to write a PROTO that inherited from another self-defined PROTO?

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/22/2022 07:05:08
Hey. Yes thats possible. Most examples of webots are based on this structure. Just for demonstration, take a look at [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles/protos/abstract](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles/protos/abstract). Here you have the `ackermannvehicle.proto` as base. The `car.proto` inherits from it. And if look one directory above (vehicles/Protos) you have further examples of some car manufactories that inherits from `car.proto` (e.g. BMW/Tesla etc). Same structure you find with the provided robot Protos (e.g. Nao) which also inherits from `robot.proto`. The same procedure you can use for self-defined PROTOS

Hi, I am using a slider joint in my robot arm and I'm using position control for it to move my robot arm. However, when the robot is traveling the robot arm keeps sliding automatically even when I have set the position to a standby location. Is there a way to hold the robot arm in a fixed position when it is not being used?   

I'm using Webots 2021b for my robot simulation and I can't seem to figure out what's wrong with my implementation. Thanks in advance.

Can you share a little video of your issue please?

##### giaco\_mz 02/22/2022 12:28:36
There are samples of batteries discharge/charge problems? Robot that once discharged their batteries comes back to home to charge

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 02/22/2022 12:48:29
May a good entry point would be [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/worlds/battery.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/worlds/battery.wbt) were you can see the usage of the charger component

##### giaco\_mz 02/22/2022 17:10:07
yes , thx


there is a way to show the node tree graphically?


now i can see only  The Scene Tree


what i mean is to see it as diagram


as shown on [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)


it should be named node chart

Hi, I'm new to the software, and  I got a warning to set Shape.castShadows to FALSE. Can anyone send me the instruction to change the settings?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 02/23/2022 04:06:05
You need find the shape that have in true this property and put it in FALSE
