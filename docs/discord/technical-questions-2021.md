# Technical-Questions 2021

This is an archive of the `technical-questions` channel of the [Webots Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/nTWbN9m) for year 2021.

## January

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 00:01:23
I tried 3.9 and 3.7, same result both times.

##### KajalGada 01/01/2021 00:39:04
`@RoboCoder` I assume you are using Windows. What did you set your Python command in Webots preferences?

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 01:32:28
I tried a few things, but right now its set to "python"

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/01/2021 11:08:41
`@RoboCoder` What PATH variables did you set exactly? You should add something like this:

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts


Unless you are on Linux or Mac, then it looks differently.

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 16:51:01
Should both of those be set in one PATH variable, or in two separate ones?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/01/2021 17:08:12
just add them beneath each other. Same variable

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 18:03:14
Okay. Does the variable name matter?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/01/2021 18:03:34
you are on windows right?


You have to change the "Path" variable [https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html)

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 18:08:16
Yep, on windows. I'll try that and get back to you.


Just wondering, does the version matter? I'm on 3.7 right now.


Okay, it's working now! I restarted the computer and it solved my issue. Thank you!

##### Yang 01/02/2021 11:50:31
Hi folks, I'm new to webots, just tried out a few examples on my PC, feels great! I'm wondering whether webots accepts urdf format files and mesh files (.stl etc.)?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/02/2021 12:37:40
`@Yang` you can directly import 3d meshes through the webots menu. In order to convert URDF to webot's PROTO format, use this:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)


I made a more detailed tutorial on how to do that:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)

##### Yang 01/02/2021 12:54:10
thank you Simon, I will check that out!

##### Nicolas Y 01/03/2021 14:30:49
Hi guys I'm also very new to Webots and I'm working on creating the 'Yamor Snake' but I can't figure out how to use 'Connectors' to get the pieces to stick together does anyone know how to get it done?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/03/2021 16:23:54
`@Nicolas Y` the hierarchy should look something like this:

Robot > children  > Hingejoint > endPoint Solid > children > Hingejoint > endPoint Solid > children > Hingejoint  ...etc

##### pnaraltnsk 01/03/2021 16:25:38
Hi, I am using webots for my graduation project and I am working on the Nao robot. I am trying to add pen node to my robot to mark the robot's walking path but for some reason, the pen node doesn't write. I added pen node to my robot's leftFootSlot and exactly like in pen.wbt example. Could you please help me out with this situation? Or do you know any other ways to mark the robot's walking path?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/03/2021 16:29:13
`@pnaraltnsk` Hi, make sure to follow the documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pen?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pen?tab-language=python)

Make sure you activated the pen and that the parameters work for you. Also keep this in mind:

In order to be paintable, an object should be made up of a Solid node containing a Shape with a valid Geometry and an ImageTexture. The painted layer is applied over the texture without modifying it.

##### Nicolas Y 01/03/2021 16:30:16
`@Simon Steinmann` Thanks! I'll try it now 🙂

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 05:21:22
hi guys, I am new in webots

I build this arena, my question is how to detect robot outside the arena? the idea is I want to make auto-referee for this arena, so which one outside first will be lose

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 06:59:01
A solid could have multiple contact point, so the `index` specifies which contact point info you want. The `index` should be included between 0 and the result of `getNumberOfContactPoints()`:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_contact_point)

Yes, the contact point can be returned only for a `Solid` (or `Robot`) node that doesn't have a direct parent `Solid` node, otherwise you will get NaN values as explained in the documentation.


The `time0to100` value is used to generate the object and compute the maximum acceleration value. So, yes, you can assume that the maximum acceleration is set only in the initialization. Given that the car is a procedural PROTO node, even if you should change the `time0to100` value, the whole robot node would be recreated and the controller will be restarted.


Hi, for your problem the best option would probably be to add a Supervisor node in your world and write a supervisor controller that monitors the status and the positions of the robots. Given that you know the size of the arena, you can get the robot position and check if it is outside:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 07:33:10
sorry to reply my own question, while waiting the answer from the other, I do some test and the answer is **Supervisor**

just add robot node and enable Supervisor in properties and make some program to get the position of the robot

thanks for reply, just test and its very easy to get robot position, many thanks for your reply

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 07:37:07
You're welcome!

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 07:38:02
the next is, how to make robot falling if outside from the arena

any idea how to build proper arena for sumo competition?

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 07:40:02
Does your robot have Physics enabled? If yes, and if the floor `boundingObject` of  your arena corresponds to the graphical round area, then robot should automatically fall once outside.

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 07:40:24
wait, check it first


this robot is e-puck, so default physics is enable, I think the problem is how I build the arena because its square floor with plane bounding, so I need to change bounding yes?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 07:44:05
Yes, a plane in `boundingObject` has infinite size. You could use a Cylinder or a Box instead

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 07:44:32
ok thanks, will try it and will give report here


wow great, thanks

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 08:24:47
`@Ardy Seto P`  A very simple way to check for "falling off" is to check the height of the robots. If the robot is below the arena surface, it loses. That's like 3 lines of code 🙂

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 08:58:07
yes, thats the idea, but how to show some notification in the arena (not in console) ? any suggestion?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:07:55
`from controller import Supervisor



\# disqualify height

y\_min = 0



supervisor = Supervisor()

timestep = int(supervisor.getBasicTimeStep())

robot\_1 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_1')

robot\_2 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_2')



root = supervisor.getRoot()

rootChildren = root.getField('children')

nNodes = rootChildren.getCount()

robotList = []

for i in range(nNodes):

    node = rootChildren.getMFNode(i)

    if node.getBaseTypeName() == 'Robot' and node.getDef() != 'referee':

        robotList.append(node)

nRobots = len(robotList)    

isActive = [1] *  nRobots

print(str(nRobots) + " Robots found")





while supervisor.step(timestep) != -1:

    for i in range(nRobots):

        pos = robotList[i].getPosition()

        if pos[1] < y\_min:

            isActive[i] = 0

        if sum(isActive) <= 1:

            print('Fight over!')

            `


`@Ardy Seto P` this is a little example of a more general approach of the referee. This way it does not matter how many robots you add and what their DEF is. The only thing that matters is, that the supervisor Robot has the DEF "referee"

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 09:08:52
wow nice, thanks for the code, will try it

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:09:11
let me know if you have questions

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 09:09:24
okay, thanks for your help

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:09:29
robot\_1 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_1')

robot\_2 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_2')



wups, these two lines are not needed

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 09:12:27
You may use supervisor labels to display notifications in the 3D view: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_set\_label](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_set_label)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:13:06
ahhh that's what I was looking for :p

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 09:13:20
Or a Display device (which may be a child of your supervisor Robot): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display)

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 09:14:55
noted, thanks for your reply

will try it after fix the arena view, its look weird only show white 😆

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:38:20
`@Ardy Seto P` added the display

even changes the color from green to red, when a robot is out 😄

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 09:47:58
Hi I have a question. I want to rotate the coordinates of the anchor. How can you do it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:48:26
What do you mean by anchor?


you mean in a hingejoint?

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 09:49:34
I want to rotate the anchor in the joint parameters of the hinge joint.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:50:02
it is relative to the parent


so you need to change the parent orientation, or add a transform node inbetween

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 09:50:53
I want to add a joint at a specific location. But I can't hold the axis of rotation in the direction I want.


Where should I add the transform node?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:52:26
The easiest solution would be to position the hingejoint with a parent transform node.


Or you position the location with the anchor, and change the axis value. but this will be less intuitive, as the axis wont be along either the x, y or z axis any more

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 10:34:14
Thank you `@Simon Steinmann`. Thanks to that, the problem was solved.

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 10:53:21

@Stefania Pedrazzi#5404  understood , but for example a two finger gripper to grasp an object , so I will have multiple contact points, and I get them by specifying the index , then how can I identify through this index that which solids is in contact !?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 12:25:03
You cannot get information about the other solid which is in contact with the current node from the Supervisor API. If you need this advanced information, then you should implement a physics plugin and retrieve this information from the `webots_physics_collide` callback function:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin?tab-language=python)

However, if you just need to check if point belongs to the contact between the two finger, then there are maybe other simpler solutions, for example to compare the returned contact points of finger 1 and finger 2.

##### yash 01/04/2021 12:48:17
Alright understood , just one more thing , we have to specify a node to use the function  -

def getNumberofContactpoints() , how to do that?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 12:53:05
There are many different ways to retrieve a node, here is the link to the documentation:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def) (and all the other functions in this section)

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_node](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_field_get_mf_node)

You can find an example in the sample simulation:

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 13:45:59
can webots save the world with lock mode? I mean object in the world can't be replace, add or remove until we insert some password or passcode?

`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  thanks a lot !

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 13:50:34
this is because, I want to share the world to student, so they cant change everything except coding the robot only

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/04/2021 14:02:48
`@Ardy Seto P` Something like that is not possible from Webots. It should be handled by your OS. For example, you can set the world file permissions to read-only mode, so only the administrator can edit it.

##### Ardy Seto P 01/04/2021 14:04:29
if I setup server like in this tutorial [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation?tab-language=python)

can other people do some programming for robot?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/04/2021 14:05:48
Yes, in that case it would be similar to:

[https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 14:15:39
`@Ardy Seto P` you can have them export their robot as a .wbo file and give you their controller as well


you can then load them into your world

##### yash 01/04/2021 14:41:58
I have set  SUPERVISOR field to TRUE, so to use  .getDevice() functions for sensors and motors ,  will robot.getDevice() be applicable ?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:23:14
`@Simon Steinmann` Hi Simon, thanks for you're help earlier but I can't seem to figure out how to 'bound' them so that all eight 'Yamors' move as one bigger whole

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 15:32:42
Yes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:32:52
You have to put a "Robot" node as your base node `@Nicolas Y`

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:33:01
I did

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:33:13
and add motors in the device section of the hingejoints


what exactly is your problem?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:35:06
I'm not sure how to get the components to stick

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:35:37
Post your world file here


one thing I can see from the screenshot is, that you have not added JointParameters


double click on them and add a Parameter node


The individual Solids also need a physics node and a bounding Geometry

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:40:17
This is my world file

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:41:45
ohhh


you added all the segments as children of the robot


you have to put each next joint into the children node of the Solid before

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:42:32
ohhh


I'll try that now

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:43:01
you can add boundingObject and physics by simply doubleclicking it


ohh wait, all the Yamor are individual robots?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:43:34
yes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:43:55
are they supposed to be individually controlled?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:44:09
no I want them to work as one

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:44:09
Because I'm not sure about a chain of robot nodes

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:44:37
oh?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:45:43
Perhaps the devs know the best solution for that. I'm not sure about Robots containing other Robots

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:47:03
oh


that complicates things

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:48:34
`@Olivier Michel` How does a hierarchy of robots work? Do the child robots act as devices if they don't have a controller assigned?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 15:49:23
No, a robot can access only the devices it contains. If a robot contains another robot, the devices of the child robot are not available to the parent robot.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:50:36
`@Nicolas Y` I think you are supposed to add one Yamor, then doubleclick on 'extensionSlot' and add another

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:51:22
`@Olivier Michel` in which case how can one replicate this?
%figure

%end

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 15:57:41
In this example (included in Webots), each module is an independent robot (there is no hierarchy).


Robots attach to each other with a Connector node.

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:59:55
`@Olivier Michel` okay thanks I'll try that

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 16:17:39
I would recommend you to start from the yamor demo and modify it bit-by-bit to ensure you are not breaking anything.

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 16:33:35
`@Olivier Michel` sorry but despite checking the website I can't seem to figure out how to use the 'Connector' node to Combine the two 'Yamor' nodes

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 16:34:45
I would recommend you to open the world file in a text  editor.


Yes, in the scene tree of Webots, but it may be easier to edit from a text editor (but this is a question of personal preferences).

##### pnaraltnsk 01/04/2021 20:28:39
Hi, I followed the documentation and checked everything else. Everything looks fine and the pen should have been working but it didn't. I am still struggling to find what's wrong.

##### TerryWr1st 01/05/2021 00:19:20
Hi all, new to this channel. I'm developing my thesis in Webots, which consists of a number of epucks at the start of the simulation. During runtime, I then need to spawn additional epucks and delete the old epucks which have served their purpose in the simulation. Is this possible in Webots? And is it achieved through a supervisor function, or some other method?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 01/05/2021 00:47:52
Yes you can do it using the supervisor, you can add and remove the nodes of the robots from the scene tree: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)

##### TerryWr1st 01/05/2021 00:50:29
Ah ok, brilliant, thank you. Will take a look.

##### mayank.kishore 01/05/2021 03:35:29
Has anyone successfully implemented RRT for a robot to get to a waypoint?

##### Alessia Valle 01/05/2021 08:54:35
Hi, I'm working on my Master Thesis and I need your help if possible. I have imported my four-wheeled robot CAD model into webots and I need to interface it with ROS (not ROS2) to implement SLAM algorithm. The robot is equipped with a Lidar sensor. I have gone through webots and ROS documentation but I am still stuck.

I have seen that to use slam\_gmapping, my mobile robot needs to provide odometry data and I need to publish two different transforms, base\_laser->base\_link and base\_link->odom. Since I am novice to ROS and I have no experience in interfacing it with webots, here are my questions:

- how to make my robot publish its odometry? my idea is to use Position Sensors, but I don't know how to turn the values from the position sensors into the standard nav\_msgs/Odometry used in ROS. I think I am missing some steps. 

- since I need to publish transforms of odom, base\_link and base\_laser to use with gmapping, do I need to create the URDF of my robot? 

Thank you in advance

##### Master.L 01/05/2021 09:11:28
Excuse me, I have a question.

I am implementing a delta robot model in webots.

There is an upper leg that moves by a hinge joint and a lower leg that is connected to the upper leg by a ball joint.

Since the hinge joint is moved after starting the simulation, the ball joint continues to rotate and the position value increases. Therefore, the part connected to the ball joint continues to rotate. How can I fix it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:15:59
`@Alessia Valle` a Position sensor measures the angle of a joint / motor. What you need is the Pose

[http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav\_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html)


this is the nav\_msgs definition

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:16:39
Hello `@Alessia Valle`,

- For odometry, see the example here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/9682e06932929ea3bfab5a6a826f6fe67471aef6/webots\_ros2\_core/webots\_ros2\_core/webots\_differential\_drive\_node.py#L128-L197](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/9682e06932929ea3bfab5a6a826f6fe67471aef6/webots_ros2_core/webots_ros2_core/webots_differential_drive_node.py#L128-L197)

(it is for ROS2 but there is almost no difference for ROS)

- You don't have create URDF to publish transforms. If your model is simple you can publish them manually, see an example for a physical robot:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/epuck\_ros2/blob/master/epuck\_ros2\_driver/src/driver.cpp#L167-L232](https://github.com/cyberbotics/epuck_ros2/blob/master/epuck_ros2_driver/src/driver.cpp#L167-L232)

(If you need URDF you can use [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_urdf](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_urdf))

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:21:38
is the ball joint passive? If so. you have to add friction


so expand the balljoint and add a "JointParameters" node


there you can edit those values

what could be the issue ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:36:45
can you click on your robot and show a screenshot (with the white lines of the bounding box)


My first guess would be, that you used the visual mesh data as collision. And your shapes are not convex


Also it seems like it might be starting partially in the floor

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:39:27
this the bounding box

how could I rectify the problem ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:40:13
oh the grey metal part is not part of the robot?


and it looks like therre is a horizontal part, which has no visual

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:40:55
no it is not the part of the robot

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:41:11
but the robot is attached to it?


In general it is much better (for performance AND accuracy) to replace the boundingObject with simple geometries, such as boxes, spheres, cylinders and capsules

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:42:08
yes I have positioned the robot accordingly, but it is not attached to it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:45:33
well it is hard to say. What do you expect to happen?

##### Master.L 01/05/2021 09:45:42
Thanks for solving it!!

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:47:12
the 2 link manipulator should rotate about it's axis provided. With the metal plate at it's position only.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:48:39
you have to make its axis static then


remove the physics node of the Robot


it still seems weird to me, that you have 3 segments in your bounding object


there is something weird there

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:50:19
oh okay, alright let me look into it, thanks !

##### nelsondmmg 01/05/2021 21:53:51
Could you cite a reference for the differential ratio calculated for the rear wheel of the vehicle? I'm assuming that a similar correction need to be made before applying the acceleration to the wheels of the vehicle, but I cannot find any reference that explains how this differential ratio is calculated. Thanks.

Can Webots compile in x86, or only x64? I went through the visual studio setup both manually,  and with the wizard. The wizard sets the configuration properties as Release/x64, but this step isn't mentioned in the manual set up guide: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide)


Also, why does the wizard default to a Release configuration instead of debug?

##### Diego Rojas 01/06/2021 05:50:10
What would be the best way to simulate a ur5 robot on a 7th axis linear track using ROS2 and moveit2? I would like to control both the linear motion of the 7th axis track and the robot arm with moveit2. Using the follow\_joint\_trajectory action server, I was able to control the ur5 robot with ros2 control and moveit2, but now I want to attach the robot to a linear track. I have done this in the past in gazebo by creating a prismatic joint and using the follow\_joint\_trajectory controller to control it with ros\_control and moveit. Is this possible in webots also? How can I utilize the existing follow\_joint\_trajectory action server that is created in webots\_ros2 and create another follow\_joint\_trajectoy action server for a linear/prismatic joint with webots\_ros2?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 07:12:43
Webots can compile controllers in either x64 or x86. However, by default it will build x64 binaries. If you want to build a x86 controller binary, you should be sure to link it with `WEBOTS_HOME\msys64\mingw32\bin\Controller.dll` instead of `WEBOTS_HOME\msys64\mingw64\bin\Controller.dll`.

##### yash 01/06/2021 07:38:12
I am working on a certain application that involves grasping a human foot. I imported the human foot CAD using .VRML format. And used the DEF geometry indexfaceset in the shape node to define the bounding object of the human foot. But the bounding object seems to be complex which is resulting in weird physics behavior.  How to address this issue such that the human foot remains stable ?

Because when I replaced the foot with a simple cylindrical solid it worked fine since the bounding object of the cylinder is not complex.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 07:48:08
The used formula comes from standard steering dynamics. Depending if the front or rear  wheels drive the car (or all four wheels) you need to compute the ratio for the left and right wheel because the do not turn using the same angle.

Here is the reference to a chapter about steering dynamics: [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8544-5\_7](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8544-5_7) but you can probably find other references on the web.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 07:53:37
You should create a compound bounding object for the foot that is not a mesh, but a combination of simple primitives (spheres, capsules, cylinders and boxes). See this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes) for an example of creating a compound bounding object.

##### yash 01/06/2021 08:01:33
alright ! but this wiil solve the issue right irrespective of the solid geometry ?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 08:02:22
It should (as long as you don't include any mesh in the bounding object).

##### yash 01/06/2021 08:02:48
understood, thanks a lot !

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/06/2021 08:48:56
Hello `@Diego Rojas`, I have never tried adding 7th axis linear track, but here are a few ideas. `TrajectoryFollower` can control any motor present in the robot. Therefore, you can add the linear track (built with `SliderJoint` which behaves in the same way as the prismatic joint) in the Webots robot model.



Alternatively, you can use `ConveyorBelt` but it is more complicated. You need to enable a `Supervisor` field of your robot and extend `trajectory_follower` to control `speed` field of `ConveyorBelt`. This will also require some basic integration to control the position of the belt as `ConveyorBelt` allows only a speed control.

##### Alessia Valle 01/06/2021 09:08:34
Hi `@Darko Lukić`, thank you again for the suggestions.  I also found on the ROS wiki website the diff\_drive\_controller  [http://wiki.ros.org/diff\_drive\_controller](http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller) but I don't know if it is useful for my purposes and if it can be used with Webots. Any idea? 

Moreover, I have another doubt about transforms and URDF. Actually I need the static transforms between the wheels, the base\_link and base\_laser to set up navigation. But how can I publish transforms without the URDF file? Do these frames take the name of the corresponding nodes on Webots?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/06/2021 09:20:51
You can use `diff_drive_controller` as well. Your objective is to publish `Odometry` topic and transforms that describe translation and orientation between `base_link` and `odom` frames. You can use `diff_drive_controller` or write one by yourself.



You don't need URDF to publish transforms. In general, `robot_state_publisher` uses URDF to publish `TransformStamped` ([http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry\_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html)) messages. However, you can publish those messages by yourself.

Hi, is there a way to move all the motors of the robot arm at the same time? For example, I would like to move the tool center point (tcp) of a ur5e in a straight line from x=0 m to x=5 m. Right now I call the  \_setPosition\_ function for each motor in a sequential order with the inverse kinematics result, and judging from the movement, the  tcp is not moving in a straight line. Especially at the start of the movement, the arm jitters. I suspect it's caused by the asynchronous movement of the motors.

I want to use the supervisor function as well as the Robot node , therefore should I write ——

And should define as -

supervisor = Supervisor() 

 

Please help me with this !?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/07/2021 12:27:32
If you set the motor positions in the single step they all move at the same time. Your problem is therefore something else. For example, the motor in shoulder moves the endpoint faster than the motor in the wrist even though they rotate at the same speed (the motor in the shoulder is farther away from the endpoint than the motor in the wrist). One solution would be to find a lot of IK solutions along a straight line and apply the new IK solution in each step.


No. `robot = Supervisor()` is enough. It will give you methods from `Robot` and `Supervisor` nodes.

##### Alessia Valle 01/07/2021 12:34:06

The most effective way to turn an epuck2 is by using time and angular speed itself. You may want to have a look at the proto file and take into account the thickness of the wheels among the other things to get a more accurate value of axle length.

##### ArjunSadananda 01/07/2021 21:41:23

Yes, you can. However to get the position of the contact point of the collision, you should use the supervisor API, not the touch sensor API.


I am sorry, but currently deploying a streaming server is not very easy, has some bugs and also is not very well documented. We are currently working on improving this, but it will take some time. Meanwhile, I am afraid, you will have to debug this kind of problem by yourself.

Maybe this one can help? [http://www.diegoantognini.com/projects/dis/](http://www.diegoantognini.com/projects/dis/)

Thank you. If anyone have an idea or doc about leader follower can share with me?

##### macieju 01/08/2021 14:23:25
could someone give me a hand with rotating an EPUCK2 robot by 90 degrees? Tried absolutely everything and nothing worked, I am a complete beginner so don't know much


and there are no resources online for it


would be very helpful


I could pay for a call teaching me on how to do it

##### Maheed 01/08/2021 14:40:49
Hi everyone, Im a webots beginner at the moment. I have 8 yamor modules connected together to look like a snake and I really need some help to program some controllers in C to make it do something such as move towards an a certain colour or avoid obstacles. Can anyone help me with this?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/08/2021 14:44:57
are you dead set on c?

##### Maheed 01/08/2021 14:46:30
Yep

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/08/2021 14:47:47
Then I wont be able to help much. But my approach would be to create basic functionality as "move forward" "turn left" "turn right" etc. And then combine those into algorithms for obstacle avoidance etc.

##### Maheed 01/08/2021 15:27:37
Okay thanks


Is there anyone here good with C who can help me with this please?

##### linexc 01/08/2021 23:58:08
Hello everyone, I have a problem regarding Webots and NAO robot. I am trying to write a ROS server and client in order to make the NAO in Webots perform some gestures. But when I tried to simulate it, the error showed always like this. But I really don't know why the network address in already in use. If anybody can help me, I would be very grateful.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/09/2021 08:26:26
`@linexc` looks like a network problem. I have no experience with this exact thing, but usually you would use localhost


which should be 127.0.0.1

thank you. I will try it now.

##### Chernayaten 01/09/2021 19:36:59
I am messing around with the pen.wbt example and I found that the floorSize and the floorTileSize have to match (for example 1 1 for both or 4 4) . Can someone explain why?


Also if anyone can help me figuring out how to make the robot(still using the one in pen.wbt) turn 90 degree angles..atm I am using setRotate(getTargetPosition() +/- Rotate) where Rotate = 2*math.pi +0.4. Not sure why 0.4 works, but it seems ok in general, except if I use a big time\_step and sometimes when I left the simulation run a while.



I feel like I should be able to use 1.0/3.0, 4.0/3.0 and stuff like that to get different angles, but I can't make it work

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 00:37:29
Hello everyone! Playing with lights and lighting in Webots.  I have placed three line follower robots using the same controller, I still don't understand how it works.  Can someone tell me how it works?

[https://youtu.be/jMzKwcVs\_08](https://youtu.be/jMzKwcVs_08)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:37:11
`@DrakerDG` Hey, what part exactly don't you understand?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:41:40
<@239507682111913984> hello! I don't understand how by duplicating or tripling the same robot (copy & paste) they can use the same controller separately.  What I mean is that I just copied and pasted them without changing anything and it worked.  Each robot can follow the line without affecting the other.  In the end I only changed the color of the chassis and nothing else.  I see that it works but I don't understand how


I understood that each robot should have its own controller, but apparently it is not entirely necessary

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:50:15
Ah okay, I understand the confusion. Each robot runs its own instance of that controller. In a separate process


does that make sense?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:53:45
<@239507682111913984> yes, thank you 😁👍🏼


<@239507682111913984> like as running the same application several times


<@239507682111913984> If it were different robots if each one is configured with their controller, right?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:56:16
yes


Usually a Controller is specific to one Robot, but you can have many instances of that Robot


you can take a look at your task-manager while running it. You should see the main Webots process, and then at least one per running controller.

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:58:23
<@239507682111913984> For example robots that play soccer use the same controller all, so

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:58:30
I mostly use Python and often need similar functionality. So I have sub-modules or scripts, which I dont change and can use in different controllers by simply importing them

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:59:09
Ok

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/10/2021 13:00:01
If you have one type of robot player, then yes, it would make sense to use the same controller. Or at least a shared base-version for stuff like movement, sensors etc.


The roles for behavior, if they should differ, could be put on top of that


What Programming language do you use?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 13:01:05
I will continue playing and I will try to make modules as you indicate.  It's very interesting


I am currently programming in C language, but I am learning in a course to start writing in Python


<@239507682111913984> My object is to use Webots to test robot designs, observe their operation, mechanical behavior, improve it and then physically build the robot

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/10/2021 13:14:31
Python is definitely easier and quicker imho

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 01/10/2021 13:17:40
<@239507682111913984>  definitely yes, the syntax is very friendly.  In the little that I have advanced I really like how simple it is


<@239507682111913984> Thank you very much for guiding me

##### Aditya Agrawal 01/10/2021 17:30:24
The error for sure pertains to the robot window's javascript file. I'm also experiencing the same error with Webots 2021 version. Went through the changelog but couldn't find anything pertaining to webots.js

##### duct 01/10/2021 17:30:50
should I stick with 2020 instead?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/10/2021 21:00:41
`@duct` , `@Aditya Agrawal`  I have just checked and `MainSupervisorWindows.html` is not valid HTML file, so `webots` cannot be injected. The file content should be something like:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script src="MainSupervisorWindow.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

##### Aditya Agrawal 01/10/2021 21:03:17
Hey, in a robot window plugin, should the js file be explicitly included using the script tag?

Yes


You can check the e-puck example:

##### Diego Rojas 01/10/2021 23:30:11
What are the steps of designing a model for webots simulation? What is the process of designing something in soldworks and making a PROTO from the mesh? This is likely a simple question, but I cannot seem to find a direct answer or demo.

Take a look at this first: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

In general, the simplest way in my opinion, would be to build up your model in webots, then export the robot as a .wbo


then you just need to add the .proto header (as described in the link)

i have a question related to webots


just visited the official website and then github and now i am here


Hi `@Darko Lukić`  how are you? remember me?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:11:47
I am sorry, I cannot recognize your username 🙁

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:12:22
i am Jamal Shams Khanzada, couple of days ago i had asked you a question on github and you helped me


and i am thankful to you


i am here for another problem to be solved.


can you still help me to solve it?


actually when i fetched gyro data recently, i started to make controller but it needs numpy

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:14:09
I recall now! I am glad I was able to help.


Feel free to ask a question and I, or somebody from the team, or the community, will probably be able to help you

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:18:34

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:23:46
You installed `numpy` for Python2, not Python3


You need to `pip3 install numpy`

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:24:31
ok i am installing


but how can i know that `numpy` is for python2 or python 3?


installed it


rebooting is necessary or not?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:26:11
No, just restart the controller


In general (not necessary), if you install it with `pip3` it is for Python3, if you install it with `pip` it is for Python2.

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:27:33
ok


i restaretd the controller but the problem is still there

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:30:08
Do you get an error if you call?

```py
python3 -c 'import numpy'
```

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:30:28
let me check it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:30:57
`@JSK` did you maybe install Webots from the snap?

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:31:31
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  yes i installed it from snap

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:32:02
Ok, then you should use extern controller:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers)

%end

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:34:13
If you installed Webots as `snap` it will not work. As `@Stefania Pedrazzi` suggested you should use external controller or install Webots as a Debian package.

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:35:26
i checked that site. i have been reading it for two days but i was actually avoiding external controller. but now i think i have to switch here on external controller


i think i should go for Debian package


isn't it necessary that Debian should be installed on latest version of Ubuntu (20.04) i am using (18.04)


i have started downloading Debian Version.


and until it is downloaded i think i should reread the documentation `@Stefania Pedrazzi` mentioned me

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:42:32
There is a debian package version for Ubuntu 18.04: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots-R2021a-x86-64\_ubuntu-18.04.tar.bz2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots-R2021a-x86-64_ubuntu-18.04.tar.bz2)

Thank you . I am so thankful to you. 🙂

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:44:16
You're welcome

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:44:20
aaaa one last question please


after the file is downloaded, how to install it? i mean should i extract the `tar.bz2` extension file or something else?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:45:58
Oops.. I linked to the tarball instead of the debian package

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:46:00
please don't mind i am a novice

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:46:42
The tarball just needs to be extracted and then you can launch it from the directory where you extracted it


Here is the link to the debian package: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots\_2021a\_amd64.deb](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots_2021a_amd64.deb)

Double clicking on it should open the Software Application window to install it

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:47:34
alright that sounds good

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:48:29
`@JSK` You may also have to set environment variables, especially when using conda

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:49:42
yeah i read about environment variables in the documentation that `@Stefania Pedrazzi`  mentioned

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:51:02
you can launch webots from a terminal. it will have the variables of that terminal

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:51:44
to be honest i tried to set the variables but when i started to search `usr/local/webots` i was not able to find that and hence i came on this platform for help. i am trying this for 3 days

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:52:11
you can edit your .bashrc in your home folder to add variables

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:53:05
what does "edit" mean.


?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:53:17
open it in a text editor and add the variables


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python)


here is more detail

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:54:51
alright

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:57:26
you can add this at the end of your .bashrc

`export WEBOTS\_HOME="/home/simon/webots"

export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH="${LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller"

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller/python38"

export PYTHONIOENCODING="UTF-8"`

keep in mind to change the first line to the correct Path of your installation, and change the python version to the correct one


`python3 --version`  to get your python3 version

##### JSK 01/11/2021 11:00:44
thanks let me do it

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:00:45
the .bashrc file gets sourced every time you open a new terminal. So you have to open a new terminal for it to take effect. Then you can launch webots from the terminal, and it will have those variables

##### JSK 01/11/2021 11:03:18
can you tell me how to access .bashrc file? i cant find it

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:03:28
it's hidden


ctrl + h to see hidden files, or `gedit ~/.bashrc` in the terminal

##### JSK 01/11/2021 11:04:05
found it


updated .bashrc as you mentioned `@Simon Steinmann` .

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:07:37
now you can open a new terminal and launch webots from there. the variables should be set


Instead of setting those variables in the .bashrc, you could set them in `sudo gedit /etc/profile`. That should set them system wide

Use a camera sensor and look into canny edge detection and hough line transform


I don't know your programming language preference, but I strongly recommend you use python since OpenCV makes it a much easier task than it seems.

Yes, but I have never used OpenCV


Are there any references on Cyberbotics website?

##### MartinG 01/11/2021 11:19:03

Parts 3 and 4 are what you'll probably find the most useful.


And it does put up a paywall after 3 visits to the site I believe, but a bit of incognito browsing never hurt anyone.


I have a question of my own, using reset simulation crashes the whole program. The world is quite complex, however even leaving it to run for a long while after hitting reset doesn't seem to help.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:23:12
Perhaps try removing things from the world one by one and hit reset after. Try to find out what is causing the crash

##### duct 01/11/2021 16:42:55
Hi again! I am trying to create a robot class with the motors, position sensors, and other stuff included in it. I am using this code:

```C++
class myRobot {
  public:
    Robot *robot;
    Motor *left;
    Motor *right;
    PositionSensor *LEnc;
    PositionSensor *REnc;
    int timeStep;
};
```

It says that 'Robot' does not specify a type, and same with 'Motor' and 'PositionSensor'. I suspect this is because something in Robot.hpp is not public.


I'm sort of a noob with C++ and OOP, so I'm not really sure what the issue is

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/11/2021 16:44:57

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 21:40:04
Would you perhaps be able to help me with the following? I want my robot to make a 90 degree clockwise turn which. I use setPosition to increment/decrement and thus move/turn the robot. I use a position sensor to properly stagger my commands so they don't overlap.



With my subpar trigonometry skills I figured that to turn the robot 90 degrees I have to inc/dec the position by (math.pi * robot\_radius)/ (2*wheel\_radius) . My simulations say I am completely wrong. Can you help me out? I can show how I reached the formula if you want

##### duct 01/11/2021 21:53:28
funny I was doing the same thing today. This is the formula I landed on, and it works:

```
theta(in radians) = 
(angle(in degrees) * robot_radius * pi)/(360 * wheel_radius)
```


so if your robot radius(something you sort of have to play with to get accurate results) is 32.5, and wheel radius is 9.5, then your setPosition should be(in radians) (90 * 32.5 * PI)/(360*9.5)


pretty sure you forgot to multiply your angle and it should be 360*wheel\_rad

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:01:55
What do you mean it is something that I have to play around to get accurate results? Why?


Your formula translates to my\_formula / 2 since 90/360 = 1/4. Unfortunately the turn my robot does is still wrong

it's not actually supposed to be the robot radius, it's meant to be the distance between the centers of the wheels, which is usually smaller than the robot radius given on the webots website


what does it do then?

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:15:37
Ahh.. yeah, I agree. The center of my wheels is right on the edge of the robot, in which case the distance should be the robot radius

##### duct 01/11/2021 22:16:01
if it is extremely far off then there's something wrong with the formula


but if instead of 90 degrees it goes 80 or 100 degrees, then just mess with the robot radius


basically what my formula does is the following(90 degrees as an example)

1. 90/360 =1/4 shows that you are going 1/4 of the circumference.

2. calculate circumference through robot\_diameter*pi, and multiply by 1/4(or whatever fraction you got from step 1). This gives you the distance that each wheel has to go in terms of cm.


then the radians that each wheel has to turn is distance/wheelRadius


putting all that together gives the final formula

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:22:44
1/4 gives me a ~43.6 turning angle, 1/2 gives me a ~45.2 angle and 1/1 (so a full circle supposedly) gives me ~62 angle

##### duct 01/11/2021 22:23:01
ooh


yeah


that's not right


this is what I have:

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:23:29
I do agree with your reasoning on how it works though

##### duct 01/11/2021 22:23:34
```
(angle*WHEELBASE*PI)/(360*WHEELRAD)
```


WHEELBASE is the robot diameter


try that


and angle is in degrees

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:26:14
This is what I am trying. btw my result was in radians, I just converted it to angle so that it makes more sense. At least for me, angles feel far more natural when it comes to visualizing them

##### duct 01/11/2021 22:26:15
*wheelbase is robot \_diameter\_, not radius


in case that was a matter of confusion


ok what's your wheelbase(\_diameter\_) and wheel radius

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:30:20
I'm pretty sure my wheelbase is the same as my robot diameter which is 0.9 and my wheel radius is 0.025.


My wheels are located on 0.045 to the left and the right of my robot, wheelbase is calculated as the distance from the center of the wheels which makes that 0.09


I'm using the robot from the pen.wbt world in the Devices Tour


I'll try playing around with the values to see if I can make it work. Thanks for taking the time, at least I know that my logic is not too far off

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 07:11:18
Just reporting. I think I found a bug (not sure), but receiving the message from the simulation server, when starting the Stream class another bar '/' is inserted in line 6 and the link becomes 'localhost:2001//mjpeg' ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/f6ebe9cf8ce64c30cf453655376a815deeb28744/resources/web/wwi/stream.js#L6](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/f6ebe9cf8ce64c30cf453655376a815deeb28744/resources/web/wwi/stream.js#L6)) . For the x3d option the problem does not happen weirdly.


I am solving that by changing the message sent from the simulation server. I will check if it will also work with 'x3d' option or if using this solution only solves the 'mjpeg' but starts the error when using 'x3d'.

delta-Theta is the angle change of the robot (you want 90° (pi/2)

delta-s  is the distance traveled by the right / left wheel

2L is the distance between wheels. (as a note here, yesterday I found more accurate results using the outside edge to outside edge distance distance of the BoundingObject of the wheels, not the wheel center)


So solving for the difference in angles/position of your wheels, the formula should be like this:

`delta_pos = delta_theta * wheelBase / wheelRadius`


Now you can put in any theta angle in radians and get the delta\_pos


delta\_pos is how much more you have to turn one wheel over the other


I recommend staying with radians all the times. The only exception maybe being when printing a message. Then just multiply an angle by 180/pi  to get degrees

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:22:18

okay... and what is the issue?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/12/2021 09:27:01
`@Luiz Felipe` Can you check whether you have node/npm installed, `npm --version`. If there is a missing dependency `make` skips compiling the corresponding part. Node should be included in the optional dependencies, but just to make sure whether it is properly installed

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:28:28
Probably that is the reason `@Darko Lukić` (npm is installed correctly but probably make skipped that when i ran the command)


does make clear works to re-build one more time?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/12/2021 09:29:20
Yes, `make clean` works

##### Apashe 01/12/2021 10:49:21
Hello everyone! recently started working with webots and I wanted to know how to get the current coordinates of the robot and point it to some point so that it gets there (I'm currently working with a robot "iRobot's Create")

how can this be done and is there an example?

now I want the robot to be able to drive from one current coordinate to another (without obstacles) on Rectangle Arena

##### Chernayaten 01/12/2021 10:50:09
GPS can get you current coordinates


Assuming you know the direction of your robot you can easily calculate the distance and the angle to your target

##### Apashe 01/12/2021 11:01:14
there are examples of how to use GPS

##### Chernayaten 01/12/2021 11:03:10
Yes, there's a gps.wbt file under the devices section.



GPS is simple to use, you can also check out its section oncthe webots site to see all the methods in your preferred language

##### owongcho 01/12/2021 16:39:37
hello! what type of simulation Webots generates? For example, is the type of simulation an emulation, discrete event simulation, or something else?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 16:41:49
I would say emulation. The time is simulated and there is a fixed time step.

##### owongcho 01/12/2021 17:43:03
I see. thank you `@Olivier Michel`

##### Chernayaten 01/12/2021 19:14:50
Thanks for the information. I haven't looked at the lecture yet, but I will do so soon. I actually came to the same result as you, the outside distance seems to work better for some reason.



I also suspect that the initial anchor positions from the given example are wrong, unless I am mistaken. From Tutorial 6 on the 4 wheeled robot, the anchor field of the HingeJointParameters node should have the same values as the Solid translation one, but the robot of the pen.wbt world is missing the x values.



I'll review your information and hopefully get a good result. Thanks again (:

##### duct 01/13/2021 00:49:06
I have the pioneer 3dx robot in between two walls. What would be a good way to ensure that the robot is straight/aligned with the wall? I tried checking two side sensors and making sure they return very similar values, or adjusting until they do, but the distance sensors are very noisy and not consistent much.

How do I make sure the robot is straight?

##### TerryWr1st 01/13/2021 01:37:07
Have you specified a noise value in the sensor lookup table? Otherwise they should be accurate. 



Also, when your robot is in the above orientation, the distance sensor rays will be sent out on an angle (not perpendicular to walls as desired), which will increase/decrease your sensor values. So you would need to know your robot orientation for this approach as well

##### duct 01/13/2021 01:37:32
wdym specify noise value?


I can pick how little/much noise I want?


and oh yeah I didn't think about the angle thing thanks

##### TerryWr1st 01/13/2021 01:41:31
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)



Scroll down to the lookup table section

##### duct 01/13/2021 01:42:37
wait so I can set my own noise stuff?


in code?


But if some competition is using webots that i'm participating in, what stops me from just setting 0 noise


how do I change the lookuptable values

##### TerryWr1st 01/13/2021 02:06:16
If the competition hasn't mentioned a restriction on sensor accuracy then dont set a noise. 



From the documentation, first column is sensor input, second column is what you want the input to represent, third column is the noise value. 



You can change these values in the scene tree (expand the fields of your distance sensor), or open the wbt file with a text editor

##### duct 01/13/2021 03:05:56

##### Wasabi Fan 01/13/2021 04:52:17
I have a small projectile (on the order of 1cm diameter in the real world) that I'd like to simulate at moderate-to-fast speeds (tens of m/s) and detect contact with a particular square surface on a target robot. This is currently using a `TouchSensor`. Unfortunately, even with a projectile a few times larger and speeds a fraction of real-world, the simulation time step is too large to consistently (or, at higher speeds, essentially at all) have a time slice in which the projectile is actually intersecting the target. In other words, the collision is never detected. This is true even if I up the simulation speed to thousands of Hz, which isn't practical anyway. As far as I can gather, TouchSensor collision detection is purely based on intersection after a discrete time step.



One solution which seems technically possible but perhaps not practical is some form of intra-step interpolation (e.g., a ray intersection check which approximates my projectile as a point -- my understanding is that ODE supports this in some form).  What are others' thoughts here? And is there actually a practical means of implementation for the above in my Webots sim, with or (ideally) without a physics plugin? Alternately, this seems to be approaching the scale at which doing a purely mathematical hit-test without ever simulating the projectile may make more sense -- however, I \_do\_  need to simulate the time-of-flight, and I'm not sure what API would be sensible for computing those collisions, if any.

##### Luiz Felipe 01/13/2021 04:56:55
`@Wasabi Fan` , does decreasing the time step does not work even implementing a collision detector using a physics plugin following: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/introduction-of-the-physics-plugins](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/introduction-of-the-physics-plugins) ?

##### Wasabi Fan 01/13/2021 05:01:28
I tried that once with a "normal" time-step (~60Hz) and it did not seem to change the results. Setting up the toolchain to compile physics plugins is a bit of extra work (which I preferred to not introduce into my general setup process), which is why I haven't done a lot of experimenting with it, but it's not out of the question. However, it's not clear to me what that sample plugin is intended to do -- is there an expectation that the joint-attachment collision handling is better in a scenario like this?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 07:11:38
A possible solution (without a physics plugin) would be to turn the bullet into a Robot with the supervisor field set to TRUE. Then, add a distance sensor to the bullet looking backwards. At each time step, you should get the current position of the bullet and compute the vector between the current position and the previous position. You will use this vector to change the orientation of the distance sensor so that it looks exactly at the previous position and make a sensor measurement in the same time step. If the distance measured is smaller than the distance between the current and previous position, then a collision occurred and you should set the position of the bullet at the place of collision (which can easily be computed along the distance sensor ray).

##### Wasabi Fan 01/13/2021 07:16:36
Oh wow, that's very inventive and \_sounds\_ workable. I think there are some details I'd need to work out but I shall try that in the next few days and report back if I run into issues. Thanks!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 11:49:28
This is correct, but is it not essential as the anchor may be anywhere on the rotation axis. However, you are right it is better to have it as close as possible to the rotating part (the wheel in this case) for stability reasons.

Hi, I'm currently using a Reinforcement Learning algorithm with webots, and therefore it ia necessary to reset the simulation to its initiql state. A strange thing happens sometimes whe I'm testing the algorithm but webots start to use a huge memory amount reaching 5GB and it increases when the simulation is reset.

Hi, can someone help me about boundingObject Box ? I'm using a Free 3D Butter Stick model in a simulation (that will be part of a robotics immersion week in college), but the mesh has probably some internal conflicts, so if I use it as the boundingObject Box the Solid will actually tilt out of the screen.

My solution is use a box shape as the bounding box, since I dont need the object to be precisely cut. Anyway, when I put the Box as the boundingObject Box, it wont go to the center of the object, and, no matter how I change the dimensions of the Box, it wont fit the object as wished. So, here is my question: Can I move the "center" (in relation to the object)  of a boundingObject Box ?


here is the pic of the uncentered boundingObject Box

##### Wasabi Fan 01/15/2021 02:32:14
I'm taking a look at this in more depth, and now realize one part of my desired functionality is that I know \_what\_ the projectile hit. There is a particular surface on the robot (at the moment, I'm enclosing it in a TouchSensor boundary) which is being aimed at, and other parts of the robot (or elements of the surroundings) \_aren't\_ something I want to detect. In fact, at these speeds, there's some risk of going \_through\_ the robot and seeing the other target on the back of that robot.



I think this could be solved if there is a way to know what object the distance sensor is seeing -- is this a possibility? One option we see is to add a `Recognition` on a camera, with small FOV, pointing in the same direction as the distance sensor, and use that to disambiguate. I think it \_should\_ work, minus approximation error for the bounding boxes and any perf hit. Is there a more sensible way?

Yes, this should work but it looks a bit overkill. Instead of this, you could add `TouchSensor` nodes in the walls and when you move back the bullet into the wall, this touch sensor would be activated so that you know which wall was hit.

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 08:37:13
`@Wasabi Fan` I'd recommend taking a more mathematical approach to this, it would execute quite a bit faster than using all kinds of sensors and what not. If you can get the current position of both the projectile and your robot and you know the size of both of them, it's as easy as a couple if conditions to check for a collision.


There's a ton of information on collision detection online, however if you have any specific issue, I'd be glad to help.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/15/2021 08:58:34
Perhaps try running it without the displays. That is a lot of memory. Sounds to me like a lot of visual data is cumulatively buffered. You could also share your project (you can pm me too) and I'll have a look.


Oh and I have some experience with RL and Webots too, just fyi 🙂

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/15/2021 09:08:49
In the Webots source code there is CCD functionality (Continuous collision detection). This would probably solve this problem. `@Olivier Michel` Is it possible to use that collision detection method? Either through a plugin or custom compile?

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 09:13:26
Where can I find it? I'd like to look through it.

libccd is the library

This might be possible but would certainly require a significant development effort.

Thanks.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/15/2021 09:17:42
I suspected as much. I hope something along these lines is somewhere on the roadmap. This is one of the few areas, where Webots is behind its competition: The low level control of physic engine settings and choice of different collision detection methods.


But I understand that it is not the highest priority and a lot of work

Are you on Ubuntu 20.04?

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 10:00:58
I think that the problem is in your last line of code, f=Node.addForce(hf,force,relative=False)

##### yash 01/15/2021 10:01:15
yes but how to rectify it

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 10:01:22
You're calling addForce from the Node object instead of on the node that you want it to be executed on.


actually no


try changing f to hf


I saw that you defined the foot as hf before the while loop


That is most likely your problem.

##### yash 01/15/2021 10:04:06
so should I define hf=robot.getFromDef("human\_foot")   in the while loop ?

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 10:04:31
No, in your last line just put an h before f


hf=Node.addForce(hf,force,relative=False)


I’m not sure that will work, but f doesn’t exist prior to that so it’s a likely cause.

##### yash 01/15/2021 10:05:46
its the same issue still, didnt work

" Note [Python]: In C++, Python and Java the keyboard functions are in a dedicated class called Keyboard. In order to get the Keyboard instance, you should call the getKeyboard function of the Robot class. "


This is what I read about the Keyboard class, whereas in your code you do kb = Keyboard()

##### Chernayaten 01/17/2021 15:22:10
Robots are located under \Webots\projects\robots . From there you can navigate to the robot you can and find the protos folder (if there is one) and find the proto file you want. So for example the Create robot proto file for me is located under "C:\Program Files\Webots\projects\robots\irobot\create\protos" and the e-puck one under " C:\Program Files\Webots\projects\robots\gctronic\e-puck\protos"

Hello,

How can we access individual value inside the SFVEC3F in proto files?


For example:

position IS frontRightLeg.x

Or

position IS frontRightLeg[0]


These both gave errors

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/18/2021 11:02:58
You cannot based on the `IS` keyword. Instead, you should rely on Lua scripting to extract the individual components of a `SFVec3f`.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/18/2021 11:04:34
OK than instead 

position IS frontRightLegHip


Where frontRightLegHip is SFFLOAT


This should work


?

Yes, see an example of this page: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/18/2021 17:13:46
Probably depends on how visually accurate you want it. The simplest method I can imagine, is using a texture of the field, and then paining with the Pen node on top of that picture, where the tractor has harvested


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pen](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pen)


that would probably have the least performance impact

Thank you very much for your help, `@Simon Steinmann` ! Except for creating a field of canola, I would also like to use a Lidar sensor to measure the height of the canola so that the harvesting header in front of the tractor can adjust its height accordingly for better harvesting.

##### Homeralf 01/18/2021 23:56:27
Hi guys,



I would like to thank the team for this great simulator, the API and documentation are so great. 

I'm a hobbyist trying to develop a muscle-based robot and I've encountered a couple of issues.



I want to carry a simulation from a single python process.

As far as I know, each robot's external controller must be contained in its own process, so I spawn multiple processes from the main process (with the corresponding environment variables).

The actual problem comes when sharing data among processes. The objects I try to share can't be pickled (serialized) because they contain SwigPyObjects. I can solve this but is cumbersome and not idiomatic.



So I have a couple of questions I hope you can help me with:

Is there a way to run controllers without spawning additional processes?

I guess the serialization problem can't be solved because of Swig, however, I think an update on the python API is on the roadmap. It is possible this may solve this issue?





Thanks in advance!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 08:19:41
`@Homeralf` Taking a step back, why do you want it to run from the same process? What data do you want to share?


In general [https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) can work really well for parallel processing and data sharing. Then there is middlewares such as ROS. Webots itself has the Transmitter and Receiver node, which you can use to send data between Robots

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/19/2021 08:45:08
Hello `@Homeralf`. I am glad you like Webots. As you mentioned, the objects cannot be serialized because of SWIG. If you saw PR with objective to move away from SWIG in favor of Python native bindings then I believe that will not solve your problem. Maybe we can do something like this:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9310053/how-to-make-my-swig-extension-module-work-with-pickle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9310053/how-to-make-my-swig-extension-module-work-with-pickle)


You cannot run the controllers in the same process

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 09:29:02
You also might want to take a look at pyro5. Could be exactly what you need

##### Homeralf 01/19/2021 09:42:57
Hello `@Simon Steinmann`



I want to run it from the same process because among other things I want to automate multiple simulations based on evolutionary algorithms.

The controllers must receive input from higher abstractions like the activations of the muscles, where the robot should be headed, the target speed of a solid, etc.



Yes, I was using the BaseManager from multiprocessing to share the data. However, it wouldn't work because the objects can't be serialized.

I would like to keep the project as lean as possible and I think using ROS may be a little bit overkill for now but I will consider it if things get complicated (I may be wrong).

Transceiver and receiver nodes seem like a good solution among robots.

Didn't know about pyro5, looks promising! I will give it a try!



Thanks for your time Simon, really appreciated it.


Hi `@Darko Lukić`,



Yes, that was the PR I saw.

Nice, looks exactly like the solution. I will try to implement it as soon as I get back from work.

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 10:20:48
Hi guys, 

I'm building a tutorial for our software. The tutorial use Webots and ROS2. So far, so good. 

Basically, I have a scene with a UR5e robot and some objects. We execute some trajectories with the followJointTrajectory action.

I would like now to go further and to do so, I need to know the position of some Webots objects in ROS2. For example, the robot move a bottle and I would like to get the bottle position to be published in ROS2 through a geometry\_msgs::Pose. 

Any idea how I can achieve this using C++/ROS2 API?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:29:20
`@gaitt` You can use Supervisor:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)



Do you use the `webots_ros2` package or you created your own interface?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:31:16
If you want positions of objects relative to others (your robot for example), then you can use this script I made. Or you can at least take inspiration from it and create it in c++

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 10:31:26
Yes I already use the  `webots_ros2` package.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:32:11
The supervisor only gives you absolute (world) coordinates. For inverse kinematics you usually need it realtive to the robot base


If you end up creating something like this in c++, it would be nice if you could share

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 10:38:43
Thanks `@Simon Steinmann`, well absolute position is what I need.


I was thinking there was an easier solution that writing a new ROS2 node.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:40:46
You need a supervisor controller (can be your ur5e). It can then get and publish the positions of anything in the simulation

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 12:06:56
then you have to either make a custom robot window, or plot it yourself with a python library

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/19/2021 15:23:29
A supervisor is used like the robot node. So you have to start a controller of a robot, which has supervisor = true checkmark in the scene tree


And instead of robot =Robot() you do robot = Supervisor()

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 15:37:11
Ok I managed to get it! It look likes, if webots is running I can't get the handle. I need first to create the supervisor and then launch webots to get the handle properly. Now let see how to parse the rootNode ...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/20/2021 08:49:55
`@gaitt` A supervisor needs to be initialized. For that a robot controller needs to be launched. Usually all robots controllers are launched, when the simulation starts. Through the use of a supervisor controller, you can start and stop other controllers. But I dont think you can start your first supervisor controller later on in the simulation.


You should also always have this open in a tab: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python)

You'll have to reference it constantly. Luckily it is very detailed. Also remember, that the `Supervisor() `also has all the functionality of `Robot()`. So you dont have to change any of your existing code, should you chose to turn your ur5e into a supervisor. All motor / sensor controls work the same

##### Majanao 01/20/2021 11:31:45
Hi all, I would like to balance the camera of the DJI Mavic. Is it possible to rotate it through a python script or do I have to add two motors to the drone model?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 11:33:53
Sure, this is possible. You will have to edit the drone model (PROTO file) to add this capability.


In fact, you don't need to edit the drone model. Instead you should create a pan tilt camera proto and add it in the `cameraSlot` of the Mavic2Pro model so that it is used instead of the default `Camera` node.

##### Majanao 01/20/2021 11:53:47
Thanks a lot. I'll try that.

##### gaitt 01/20/2021 17:15:06
`@Simon Steinmann` Ok I see. Thanks a lot. 

Another question: can we add other sensors to a predefined robot. I use the predefined UR5e and so the controller is external. 

My goal would be to add a fixed rangefinder to the UR5e base and access it from my ROS2 node to process the depth image.


BTW, is there somewhere a piece of code to transform a rangefinder depth image to 3d points in world coordinate frame?

##### Apashe 01/20/2021 17:28:43
Hello, what is the distance between the wheels and the radius of the wheels themselves for the robot E-puck?

I did self.wheel\_radius = 0.021 and self.distance\_between\_weels = 0.052

but I don't have the full turn angle converge (I do it through the values PositionSensor)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/20/2021 17:31:46
`@Apashe` This may help:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-E-puck-for-ROS2-Beginners#differential-drive-calibration](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-E-puck-for-ROS2-Beginners#differential-drive-calibration)


Yes, you can add any node to `toolSlot`


```py
def depth2pointcloud(depth_image, k_matrix):
    inv_fx = 1.0 / k_matrix[0, 0]
    inv_fy = 1.0 / k_matrix[1, 1]
    ox = k_matrix[0, 2]
    oy = k_matrix[1, 2]
    image_height, image_width = depth_image.shape
    points = np.zeros((image_width * image_height, 3), dtype=np.float32)
    counter = 0
    for y in range(image_height):
        for x in range(image_width):
            dist = depth_image[y, x]
            # This follows the coordinate system of the gripper
            points[counter, 1] = -np.float32((x - ox) * dist * inv_fx)
            points[counter, 2] = -np.float32((y - oy) * dist * inv_fy)
            points[counter, 0] = np.float32(dist)
            counter += 1
    return points[:counter].astype(np.float32)


def get_calibration_matrix_from_range_finder(range_finder):
    image_width = range_finder.getWidth()
    image_height = range_finder.getHeight()
    focal_length = 0.5 * image_width * (1 / math.tan(0.5 * range_finder.getFov()))
    k_matrix = np.array([
        [focal_length, 0, image_width / 2],
        [0, focal_length, image_height / 2],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ])
    return k_matrix


def get_point_cloud_from_range_finder(range_finder):
    depth_image = np.asarray(range_finder.getRangeImage(), dtype=np.float32)
    depth_image = depth_image.reshape((-1, range_finder.getWidth()))


    k_matrix = get_calibration_matrix_from_range_finder(range_finder)
    return depth2pointcloud(depth_image, k_matrix)
```

This snippet creates a point cloud in the range finder's reference frame.

I know, but the principle is the same. You rotate the robot and move it along the line to calibrate it

##### Apashe 01/20/2021 17:40:19
I used the standard example for PositionSensor from Webots and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSjTWcTojHg&t=536s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSjTWcTojHg&t=536s)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/20/2021 17:41:01
`@Apashe` 

```py
DEFAULT_WHEEL_RADIUS = 0.02
DEFAULT_WHEEL_DISTANCE = 0.05685
```

You can use these values

##### gaitt 01/20/2021 17:42:35
I did try `toolSlot` but as I expected it moves when the robot moves, I would like my rangefinder to be in a fixed frame

##### Apashe 01/20/2021 17:42:36
Thank you I'll go try it

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/20/2021 17:43:33
I see, in that case you can add it in directly in the world

##### gaitt 01/20/2021 17:53:08
I'm not sure how, could you elaborate? Device node must belong to a robot node, right?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 01/20/2021 19:13:51
Yes, you would have two robot and two controllers, one of them just publishing the point cloud


Alternately, you can add the range finder to the UR PROTO directly

##### gaitt 01/21/2021 08:23:49

Hey Darko, so I have tried the first approach. I added a 2nd robot with only the kinect in it. The robot controller is set to extern, supervisor is true for all robot. But when I launch the "webots\_robotic\_arm\_node", it seems to me that the joint state publisher get stuck! My custom ROS2 node seems to behave correctly and is loaded as controller for the 2nd robot. Can we have multiple supervisor, 1 per robot?

<@132121297277812736> your mesh file seems to be faulty. How did you generate it? There is tools and programs that can fix meshes. Webots told you the things that might be wrong


And for boundingObject, it is always better to approximate it with a simple geometric shape, such as a sphere, box, cylinder etc. It will make the simulation more stable and much faster


Should fix your second issue too

Our robot has a set of omniwheels attached to encoders.  Each omniwheel can only rotate in one direction, but moves freely in the other direction.  This makes them ideal for capturing actual robot movement in the X and Y direction (we use this for position localization).  Does anyone have a suggestion for how best to model this in webots?    I could add a position sensor to a cylinder, but I worry that the drag in the other direction would mess things up.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/25/2021 07:21:27
The red/pink bounding objects means that this objects is colliding with some other objects. Then, if the object doesn't move any longer, after a while the boundingObject will turn blue. Otherwise if there is no collision the boundingObject color is white.

Hi ! I am using def getTorqueFeedback() function to compute torque of a mani[pulator link. I set the max available torque by using the function setAvailableTorque() to 2N.  Then I supply a velocity to the motors. So when I note down the values from the torque feedback, the values are not constant ? Since providing constant velocity to the motor, the torque should also be constant right ?


Please help me regarding this.

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/25/2021 09:25:31
Thank you!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/25/2021 10:29:08
Hold something in a stretched out arm at your side and lift it up until you hold it horizontally. The torque required at your shoulder changes constantly, even if you move at constant speed. When accelerating or compensating external forces (stretched out arm), you need more torque. Without load and a constant speed, you need no torque (or just a little bit to compensate for friction)

##### yash 01/25/2021 10:35:02
therefore , since the link has mass, so when actuating it at a constant velocity the torque will change ?

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/25/2021 13:54:21
if a link has no mass it theoretically requires no torque to accelerate, does any child of the link have any mass?

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:13:00
Yes the link has mass , so definitely it will require torque

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:13:33
ah sorry i misread your message

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:14:04
I give constant velocity, so the torque should also be constant right ?


Given by gettorquefeedback() function

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:16:36
lets assume there is no gravity, at the beginning of the motion you will need some torque to accelerate the joint, when the joint has reached its desired velocity, you might need some torque to overcome friction, at the end of the motion you will require some torque in the opposite direction to decelerate the joint


if you now have gravity, the joint has to apply torque to overcome that gravity pulling on the center of mass of the attached link, depending on the angle between the gravity vector pointing downwards and the angle of the joint to the link it will require more or less torque to overcome this force

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:21:31
Therefore as per your your statement , there will always be increase or decrease in the torque .?

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:22:05
it depends on what external forces are acting on the link

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:22:24
Only the gravity

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:22:28
Just to make sure, do you understand what forces, torques, velocities and accelerations are? And how they interact with one another?

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:23:33
Yes.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:25:00
Okay, so lets assume an instance, where there is no gravity, and no friction. In this case, you only need torque to accelerate or decelerate. Remaining still,  or at constant velocity, requires no torque.


Is this clear, or is there something you want me to explain in more detail?

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:28:08
Oh okay , well understand !

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:29:13
Now we turn gravity on. It will pull on the link and joint. This creates torque in the joint, assisting or fighting against the motor. So the motor torque has to change

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:30:56
Alright , because of the gravity or some exeternal force !

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:31:45
Just imagine, you would suddenly turn the motor off, and it would just be a joint without friction. Would anything fall down, slow down, speed up? If the answer is yes, the motor would have to apply a torque to counter that

Hello. Sorry to bother again with questions:



I'm trying to do a parallel manipulator, similar to the stewart platform, and i'm trying to close the kinematic loop. Like the stewart mechanism, this manipulator has a fixed platform and a mobile platform.



What i'm trying to do is defining the mobile platform. The mobile platform pose in space relative to the fixed is quite simple, but relative to the last joint is fairly complicated.

Is there any way to generate the mobile platform solid relative to the base (basically just making it a children of the robot node) while being a movable solid?



If I create the mobile platform as a children of the robot node, it won't move no matter how much force the actuators make. Also, if i remove all the links, the mobile platform just stays afloat, ignoring gravity. All solids in question have a physics node. On the other hand, if i create it as a child of the last joint, it behaves properly.



I tried to follow the stewart platform example, where they generate the mobile platform as a child of the last joint, but i was trying to avoid this path.



Thank you

Hi everyone! Hope you can help me with this, I have the 3d model of a specific traffic cone and I'm trying to put it some physics but im stuck with the bounding object.

First, I tried to use the mesh of the 3d model but when I run a sim im getting this error: "Your world may be too complex." that's obvious because the mesh got many faces.

Then I thought in using the cone geometry shape but apparently webots doesn't support the cone as a Bounding Object.

What do you suggest? Is there any way I can modify the default traffic cone of webots (because this one has physics)?

This is one of the cones I wanted to introduce in the sim:

Is there a method Webots to create a 'ghost' robot (pure pose transformation through space without the effects of gravity and collisions affecting it?). This is shown in the video below. The robot in the darker shade is present in the physical world, whereas the other one is a ghost [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWxIjtMMFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWxIjtMMFI)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 06:56:38
Yes, this possible by creating a robot without physics and animating it from a supervisor controller.

Hello  there team


i am programming a controller for drone.


it takes of at 68.5


but i have given it more than 100 but it is not flying


motors are moving i.e. showing rotation


but the drone is not taking off


what could be the possible reason?


i am stuck here. need help

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 07:45:06
How did you create your drone model? Did you create it from the Mavic example?

##### JSK 01/26/2021 08:13:09
yes


Excuse me!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 08:29:10
I would recommend you to revert back to the original drone model to check if it works with your controller and make changes step-by-step to identify where did the problem come from.

##### JSK 01/26/2021 09:30:03
Actually that drone is just imported in my\_first\_Simulation. it has nothing but just a drone. it is flying with "mavic2pro.c" controller but its not flying for mine. although  i have supplied rotor inputs. here is a screenshot of my envoirment.

Perhaps share your project. It's hard to tell otherwise

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 11:46:01
Is there a way to chain transform nodes in a bounding object? The bounding object allows a transform node with a shape child, I was wondering if there's a way to chain multiple transform nodes, where the last one has a shape child.


Or if there's a way to automatically compute the equivalent transform

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 11:48:08
With just translations you can simply add them. Otherwise you have to do matrix multiplication


I'm sure there is online calculators for that. Basically you want to do forward kinematics


You can also see the translation and rotation of a node relative to others in webots

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 11:55:08
Yeah, i have the transform on matlab. But i was trying to dynamically generate the manipulator, for given vector of design parameters, without having to manually input the transforms


Thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:07:31
You may be able to simply chain them. I don't know if it works or not

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:14:26
Its a chain of 3 transform with both rotation and translation. I could indeed multiply the matrices to obtain the equivalent transform, and then extract the translation and rotation, but i was wondering if there was a tool, in the PROTO, to automatically compute the chain of transforms. Or if there was a way to allow the chain to be interpreted as one transform in the bounding object

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:15:19
try it out

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:16:25
I tried tried to chain them, but webots says it only allows a transform with a shape/geometry child, not a chain of transforms with a shape/geometry child:

"A Transform node inside a 'boundingObject' can only contain one Shape or one Geometry node. The child node is ignored.!"

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:21:20
I think the structure of the proto you want is something like this:

```
Robot {
  Solid {
    translation ...
    rotation ....
    boundingObject Transform {
      translation ...
      rotation ...
      children [
        Box {
           size ...
        }
      ]
    ...
    }
    children [
      Solid {
      next link in the kinematic chain
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


the transform of the bounding object is relative to the solid

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:30:35
Exactly, my problem is that, given the kinematics, i have to describe the bounding object with a chain of Transforms, like:

```
Robot {
  Solid {
    translation ...
    rotation ....
    boundingObject Transform {
      translation ...
      rotation ...
      children [
        Transform {
          translation ...
          rotation ...
          children [
            Transform {
              translation ...
              rotation ...
              children [
                Box {
                 size ...
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    ...
    }
    children [
      Solid {
      next link in the kinematic chain
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


And he doesn't allow this chain of transforms

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:32:34
how are your solids connected?

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:33:58
with ball and hingejoints


When i try to chain transform it says:

 A Transform node inside a 'boundingObject' can only contain one Shape or one Geometry node. The child node is ignored.

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:34:23
but there are multiple bounding boxes in each link?

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:35:11
No, each link only has one bounding object

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:36:02
then the bounding box for each link should be inside that link (or solid how it is called in webots)


otherwise they will not move if the robot's joints move

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:38:36
So the bounding shape must be a child of the solid and called to be used in the bounding object?

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:40:25
i am not quite sure what you mean by "called to be used in the bounding object"


but yes the bounding object should be a child of the solid

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:41:11
A solid node has the field BoundingObject, that's where you add the collision geometry

This is what i'm trying to do

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:41:40
the visual shape you add in the children field

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:41:48
Sorry for the horrible indentation


But it doesn't allow me, because the MOBILE\_PLATFORM\_SHAPE has a chain of Transforms. If it was only one transform it would work

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:43:22
the Shape has to have the DEF

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:44:53
Yeah, but if i do that the boundingObject will be in the wrong place, because it loses the transforms


I could start with the chain of transforms, and define the solid has a child of it. But this is a end-effector of a joint and it only allows the end-effector to be a solid

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:46:37
why do you need that chain of transforms anyways?

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:50:49
Basically i'm trying to describe where the blue platform is in space. And i don't know where it is relative to the green joint, but i do know where it is relative to the red plate.



So i'm transforming the coordinate system from the green joint referential into the red plate referential.

I could know where the blue plate is relative to the green joint, but the direct kinematics are fairly complicated and i was trying to avoid that path

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:52:55
you should start by defining your kinematic chain as solid->joint->....->solid

where the solid after a joint is in the endPoint field of the joint and a joint after a solid is a child to the solid

you also put in the translations and rotations between the solids in the translation and rotation field of the joint, make sure to also set the joint parameters of the joint correctly

then you can put the bounding objects into the solids where the transform you set it to is relative to the solid it belongs to

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:58:57
Thank you. I'm doing that, i started by following the Stewart platform example

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:59:03
the pose of the blue table is based on the pose of green rods, therefore it has to be defined relative to the green rods

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 13:00:05
Yes, the problem is that implies solving the direct kinematics, which are nontrivial in parallel manipulators


For instance, in that manipulator it implies solving a system of 6 nonlinear equations


Thank you for the help!

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/26/2021 13:09:24
yes you are right, it's really a lot more difficult for parallel manipulators..

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 15:21:46
of course, just add a new object and load in your model for the visual shape and Bounding object

##### alejanpa17 01/26/2021 15:28:13
the problem is that my model has too many faces so the sim is giving me "Your world may be too complex."

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 15:29:10
you should approximate the bounding object with simple geometries


you can also specify the inertia matrix yourself.

##### jejay 01/26/2021 15:47:32
Hey guys I have a few questions: There is a kinematic mode mentioned (no physics, just animations) in the docs but it is not clear to me how to use it. Can I import animated objects (e.g. a car+trajectory animation) that I exported from blender? is there curves, interpolation etc?


and the other question extends this: is there a way to import humans + skeletal animation, again in kinematics mode?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 15:51:46
The `TrafficCone.proto` has a `physics` field which is set to `NULL`. Simply adding a `Physics` node in there should add physics to it.


The `boundingObject` of the `TrafficCone.proto` is approximated with a `Box` and 3 `Capsule` primitives.


Simply removing the `Physics` nodes will disable physics in the simulation. Then, you will be able to animate the model from a supervisor controller by changing the `translation` and `rotation` fields of the objects you want to move.


As for human, see `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/humans/pedestrian` for some simple robotic human models.


Webots also support skeletal animation, see `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/rendering/worlds/animated_skin.wbt`. However we do not distribute human model with skeletal animation, but it was tested and works.

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:00:08
interesting, thanks!


so there is no simple way to play back a prerecorded animation or one that has been included e.g. in a collada file other than implementing it on your own step by step?

##### alejanpa17 01/26/2021 16:05:41

the motion functions ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions)) are for physics/actuators only? I dont understand how you record them and where the motion editor is that is mentioned in the docs

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 16:09:39
The motion editor doesn't exist any more. The motion functions work for both physics and non-physics actuators.


We have some skin animation code in the works: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-doc/pull/96](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-doc/pull/96) but it didn't yet reached the release.


The motion editor is actually deprecated and provided only for the Robotis-OP2 robot: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#motion-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#motion-editor)


But you can create a motion file from a simple text editor (the format is human readable).

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 16:15:27
you can also make a simple controller and use a supervisor to set jointagnles or right out the position and orientation of solids


and just read your trajectory or whatever you have and execute it in a loop

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:37:17
ah maybe actually one final thing. If I stay in physics mode and take for example the bmw scene. Now I turn on manual mode and drive around. Can I record this into a motion file to replay the physics control in a later simulation? or would I need to write a controller that records my actions and then write those into a motion file (which in then could also be my own file format)?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/26/2021 16:38:12
you can record and replay anything you want. You could log the position of the whole model for example, and the then just replay that


with a supervisor you can set anything really

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:38:46

In Webots? You can add a camera to a Supervisor robot or drone and take the images. Then, add the images to a software such as Pix4d (but probably there is a free alternative) to create a map.

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/28/2021 08:42:52
you can create a 3d model (many formats such as .stl, .obj, .dae and .blend are supported)

Hi everyone, I recently downloaded Webots and when I went to make my own world, it comes up with an error saying that it can't find 'wbmath' and when I look at the file directory the files aren't there in any capacity - does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve that issue, would it just be a matter of reinstalling the program?

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/29/2021 10:45:11
how did you install webots?

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:45:58
Via the cyberotics website using the newest Windows version it had available

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/29/2021 10:47:30
I'm sorry I don't know much about windows, maybe someone else can help with that.

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:48:04
That's fine, thank you for trying anyways 🙂

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/29/2021 10:48:59
Can you run the other demos of Webots (e.g., guided tour) without any problem?

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:49:43
I opened the introductory demos, all of them I believe, with no issues at all

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/29/2021 10:50:48
So what is particular with your world file? Did you add any specific object?

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:52:10
I created a new project Directory via the wizard and ticked all the boxes when given the option but then the 'rectangle arena' caused an error but the rest of the world loaded successfully


I added a model of BB-8 after I created the world and the floor didn't work

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/29/2021 11:33:29
I tried, but cannot reproduce this problem (tested on Windows 10).

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 11:34:53
I don't understand how, after no tampering on my part, that the file was deleted, I don't know how it happened and I doubt I could reproduce the issue but reinstalling the program seems to have solved the issue for now

##### smasud98 01/30/2021 05:29:13
Hi everyone! I am new to webots and not sure if this is the right place to be asking this question. I am considering getting the Macbook with the M1 chip which uses ARM. I was wondering if anyone knows whether Webots will work well with this. Thanks

##### kRiSh 01/30/2021 06:03:49
Wait for this year's lineup.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 14:23:48
`@smasud98` This is generally the right place to ask any questions regarding Webots. I think you should be fine with the macbook. While Webots is an x86 program, Apple's Rosetta 2 - x86 emulation seems to be very good and powerful. In general you should ask yourself the question though, whether a macbook is the right tool. If you want to dive deep into programming and development, engineering applications and linux, then it might be more advisable to get an x86 machine.  Perhaps you can tell me what you want to use your laptop for in general. Whether you are willing to switch to linux and/or linux is another big factor.

##### kRiSh 01/30/2021 15:24:37
Yeah well said.

He told me that he is more interested in getting a Mac than a Linux machine, he says that he has the 2015 Macbook and webots runs very slowly in that.

Also, not all the apps and programming languages are configured to run on the M1.



So he says if Webots does not run on it, he will just return and take the refund back.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 15:39:30
The new macbook is a completely new hardware & software product. It probably works really well for a pure consumer, but as soon as you start development and go outside of MacOS, I foresee a lot of issues. Linux can run on arm, but by far not all software and programs.  I have a Lenovo Legion laptop. It is basically a gamer laptop, that looks more professional. I bought it for robotic simulation and Reinforcement Learning. I dont see macbooks being a good choice for that. For AI you kinda need a Nvidia GPU, and a powerful x86 CPU is a godsent when compiling and running lots of parallelized code / many instances.

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 15:46:55
Hi everyone, i'm having an issue with a basic HingeJoint for a wheel


I have a differential robot, and when it's turning in place, le wheels are "moving sideways"


like on a bad bike


By looking at the tree I see small  values in the `translation` field of the wheel although the joint is configured to only allow rotation on an axis

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 15:51:18
can you share your world or a screenshot of your hingjoint? with JointParameters expanded in the scene tree

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 15:58:32
it is always good practice to have the same anchor as translation of the endPoint solid.  currently it rotates around the y-axis of in the 2nd image


move the anchor to where you want the center of rotation to be

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 15:59:18
Oh, ok


On top of my Hinge I have a Transform


I can remove the Transform, and instead use anchor & translation on the endpoint solid right ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:00:19
the transform is fine.


send me your world, i can have a quick look


the issue is, if you have a translation of the endpoint, which is NOT along the rotational axis

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 16:07:04
The translation of the enpoint was the result of the bug, I did not manually edit these  values

I just tried this, deleting the Transform above the Joint, no success

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:08:58
the translation of the endPoint changes with when the joint rotates. So at the start, the anchor and translation have to be the same (assuming you want the endPoint to rotate around its origin)

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 16:09:47
which is the case on my last screenshot right ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:10:47
this should work too

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 16:10:53
Which is also the case when the transform is done above; I have the same endpoint translation and anchor


Still have the problem though 😄

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:11:06
what problem?

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 16:11:50
When the robot is turning in place, the wheels are slightly translating


instead of only rotating around the joint axis

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:12:54
I would have to see the whole thing. But just stick with the solution that works


that is the 'proper' way to do it

##### Axel M 01/30/2021 16:13:06

##### Azer Babaev [Starkit, TC] 01/31/2021 20:20:54
Hello, can’t figure out why two solids pass through each other like non-material objects during simulation running. Bounding objects are defined and physics is added for both solids. Could it be due to that dencity is -1, but mass has positive value? Could it be due to that inertia matrix is not added? Could it be due to that center of mass is not added for solids?

##### paperwave 01/31/2021 22:33:56
`@Azer Babaev [Starkit, TC]` When you click on the boundingObject node you should see the bounding region surrounding the Solid, if you don't see it, it may be covered from your graphical view.

##### Azer Babaev [Starkit, TC] 01/31/2021 22:35:44
Bounding region covers solid and I can see it

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/31/2021 22:37:09
the density field is used to calculate the mass by using the volume of the bounding object, if a mass is specified it should be -1


are the two solids that should collide part of the same proto?

##### Azer Babaev [Starkit, TC] 01/31/2021 22:38:07
Solids are designed by myself from primitives

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/31/2021 22:39:22
what i am trying to ask is if the two solids are defined in the same file?

##### Azer Babaev [Starkit, TC] 01/31/2021 22:39:41
Yes

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/31/2021 22:40:09
in the robot node, there is a parameter selfCollision, you might need to enable that

I see, it doesn't have that because it was a base node.


looking for the wbt file, maybe that'll do it


It's my second day of webots so I know it's something simple

##### jasper [Moderator] 01/31/2021 23:10:47
The problem is that it is probably save in a location where you can not edit it (because you need sudo or admin). Copy the proto file from your webots installation to your own proto folder


maybe this helps to understand how you should structure your webots projects: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)

##### paperwave 01/31/2021 23:13:19
moving the protos folder now


Looks like this part of the tutorial only uses base nodes so there was no proto on it however, I restarted Webots and was able to rename the wheels which is great. Fixing something else I messed up present, thanks for the help

There is a dedicated window to edit the field, but it seems that you hide it.

It is located just below this scene tree.

So to show you can click on the sidget separator (indicated by the three lines on the bottom of your screenshot) and drag it up, or restore the default application layout from the `Tools > Restore Layout`

    device = robot.getDeviceByIndex(i)

    print(i, '  -  ', device.getName(), '   - Model:', device.getModel(),'   - NodeType:', device.getNodeType())

    # if device is a rotational motor (uncomment line above to get a list of all robot devices)

    if device.getNodeType() == 54:  

        motors.append(device)

        minPositions.append(device.getMinPosition())

        maxPositions.append(device.getMaxPosition())

        sensor = device.getPositionSensor()

        try:

            sensor.getName()

            sensors.append(sensor)

            sensor.enable(timeStep)

        except Exception as e:

            print('Rotational Motor: ' + device.getName() + ' has no Position Sensor')


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

this is an example, how I initialize robotic arms. It automatically creates a list of all rotational motors, their position sensors and the corresponting min and max positions


motors = [] missing in the first line


This works regardless of what robotic arm I use. I'm sure you can adjust it to your needs

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/01/2021 15:39:16
You are right, there is no such sensor. But basically, this can be implemented at the controller level from a standard camera flow, not inside Webots.

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 16:39:29
I'm trying to make k-team's hemisson robot rotate around itself using the setPosition command in Python (with getTargetPosition +/- rotate\_value). However whether I try to increase the position or decrease it the robot always moves forward


I'm also facing an issue with its pen node which simply doesn't work at times. I've made a few tests starting it from random positions and it might work or it might not work. At times when it is not working, if I start manually  moving the robot around while the simulation is running it might write a bit and then stop or it might start writing normally

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/01/2021 18:34:50
the setPosition most likely changes the wheel angle, not the robot rotation. So to rotate, you have to turn one clockwise and the other ccw

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 18:39:45
That is what I am doing. I use the motor.getTargetPosition() to get the position at that specific moment and then increase one wheel / decrease the other to make it turn. I've already used this code on a robot I made and it has been working without issues


I've performed the following simple test. Set both wheel positions at 100 and run it. The robot moves forward. Reset and set both wheel positions at -100. Robot moves forward again, even though it should be moving backwards

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/01/2021 18:53:34
for wheels you should probably use velocity control


and change the angles incrementally. Also remember, that the values are radian


so 100 is a lot

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 18:56:41
I've been trying to make the robot turn exactly 90 degrees (and then other angles) which is why I have been using position instead. I am aware values are radian,  the 100 is just an example to show it is not working as it should


Weirdly enough, if I do use setVelocity with +/- on the wheels it does work as it should. I really don't want to have to re-work my code though. The setPosition should be working as well which is what I am trying to solve

##### Axel M 02/01/2021 19:05:13
Hi everyone, I was wondering if someone tried to use asyncio for a python controller ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/01/2021 20:02:38
if your starting position is -200, then it will drive forward in both cases, setting the target to -100 and 100

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 20:38:15
That's why I said in my first message that I use the .getTargetPosition() method. The increase/decrease is always done in regards to the wheel position at that moment. That means that if my starting position was -200 then one wheel would increase to -100 and the other would decrease to -300

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/02/2021 10:57:01
`@Chernayaten`  Why are you using .getTargetPosition() instead of using the position sensor to get the current position?


positionSensor = motor.getPositionSensor()

positionSensor.enable(timestep)

pos = positionSensor.getValue()


I suspect that the issue lies here


.getTargetPosition()  gives you the last command issued with setPosition() and NOT the current position

##### Chernayaten 02/02/2021 13:12:48
I am doing it this way because I do not care about the current position of the motor. My code is working correctly in my own robot, it works correctly on a different robot I randomly picked (Lego's Mindstorms), but it doesn't work correctly on the Hemisson robot.


while self.step(self.TIME\_STEP) != -1:

    left.setPosition(left.getTargetPosition() - 10)

    right.setPosition(right.getTargetPosition() + 10)


Regardless of whether this is the smart way to do it, the following code should make the robot constantly rotate around itself. Hemisson robot doesn't do that and I can't figure out why. At the same time the other two robots I mentioned do

Hi guys, I'd like to create a crop field for a lidar detection simulation. I found out that Webots provides Trees and Plants objects. My questions are, 1. Can the Tree and Plant objects (shape and leaves) be detected by a lidar in the simulation? 2. Is there a way to create a crop object by myself? Thank you!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/03/2021 15:07:50
Hello `@John520`, 1. Yes. You can create a simple robot, add a Lidar, and visualize the point cloud (option in the View menu). 2. Yes. Create a terrain, add some plants, trees...



There are a few examples on YouTube (created in a very old version of Webots):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7YFyVZc1Eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7YFyVZc1Eg)


Hello `@LucasW`, the returned values from the DistanceSensor node are in meters.

##### John520 02/03/2021 15:13:24
`@Darko Lukić` Thank you very much for your reply. Would be possible to create a crop or plant that is not included in the Trees and Plants objects by myself. For example, can I create a cereal object somewhere and then import it into Webots? Thank you!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/03/2021 15:14:47
Yes, of course. It is just a matter of creating a new proto file.

##### gaitt 02/03/2021 15:16:22
Hello, I'm wondering how do I retrieve the camera behind a DEF. I'm using C++ API, supervisor->getNodeFromDef(CAMERA\_DEF) which seems to return valid pointer on a Node. But since a Device/Camera does not inherit from node I can't cast it to a camera ... any clue?

##### John520 02/03/2021 15:16:59
Oh sounds great! Thank you `@Olivier Michel`. Would you have any tutorial about creating a new proto file? Could you share a link, please? Thank you!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/03/2021 15:17:15
You should use the `getCamera` method instead.

##### LucasW 02/03/2021 17:30:19
Thanks `@Darko Lukić` but I don't think I was very clear. I'm a confused by the lookup table response values. I've read the Webots documentation but still not sure how you set the response values based on different sensors. For example in the webots\_ros2/webots\_ros2\_epuck/protos/E-puck\_enu.proto there is a tof sensor. Which approximates the VL53L0X sensor and I don't understand why those corresponding response values were chosen, I've looked at the sensor documentation and the Webots documentation and am still not sure why?

`@kRiSh` Thanks. I forgot about it.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/04/2021 07:04:37
IndexedFaceSet are usually designed as meshes in a 3D modelling software (like Blender or other) and then exported to VRML97, copy/pasted in to the PROTO file.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/04/2021 07:20:32
You should add it in the `turretSlot` filed of the e-puck.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/04/2021 08:06:40
Ok, I see. It is possible that GCtronic integrated API that returns scaled values. However, if you don't have a strong reason to use the `lookupTable` parameter, you can skip modeling that part. Without the lookup table you will get actual distance. The other parameters, `numberOfRays`, `aperture`, and`resolution` are more important for modeling a realistic sensor. Also, you can use the lookup table without scaling the values, only imposing a noise at different distances.

Hi everyone! I have a question about Fluid. I looked at the 'floating\_geometries' example, and in my simulation, I set the sane fluid properties, like I set shape, velocity, and boundingObj, and build a solid, set its immersionProperties, but it doesn't work, this solid doesn't even flow in the fluid.


`@Darko Lukić` I added a solid box in the 'floating\_geometries' example, and added shape, immersionProperties, boundingObj, damping, as other geometries, but this solid won't flow with the water. Can you help me? I don't understand why.

I am a bit confused as to how some of the supervisor funtions work, maybe someone can explain or point me some documentation. The supervisor functions allow me to retrieve nodes in the world either with ID or DEF ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-os=linux&tab-language=c++#supervisor-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-os=linux&tab-language=c++#supervisor-functions)),



 is this the same DEF that is used in the proto file for the DEF-USE mechanism ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-2-modification-of-the-environment#def-use-mechanism](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-2-modification-of-the-environment#def-use-mechanism)) or is it something different?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/05/2021 18:23:59
`@jasper` in the scene tree, you can give any node a DEF. You can then retrieve that node with the supervisor


nodes inside of proto files are a bit more tricky

you can expose fields in a proto


like you do line 8 -> line 21


you can do that for any field

should work the same

I guess you could add a parsable option, to turn urdf link-names into DEF names for the solids, not just solid names

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/05/2021 18:40:58

`@Simon Steinmann`  i made a pull request, thanks again for your help [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/pull/107](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/pull/107)


I think it depends on your use case, to convert the model to a proto you can use [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter) as far as i know. If you want to very precisely place every little wheat plant you need individual models, if you only want to place it roughly you can probaly use the tiles they provide in the models you linked to. You need to pay a little attention to the amount of polygons you are using in the end, the models you linked to are quite high resolution and it might cause some issues if there is a gigantic amount of them on the screen.


if they do not come as a tile, you can create your own tile using single wheat plants. for that [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use) is probably useful

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/06/2021 10:55:52
`@A.Padmanabhan` you have to add an entry in the .bash\_aliases launching the executable


`alias webots='/home/simon/webots/webots'`  something like this

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/06/2021 11:37:01
It depends on what you want to detect. If it is just a red circle on a flat background open cv is fine, if you want to detect different object classes you might want to use yolo, but it could be overkill

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/06/2021 11:39:07
I've only dabbled in computer vision, but I think going opencv first is the best approach. You can add YOLO to opencv

Is this the first time you start Webots or at some point it was starting?

##### Park Jeong Woo 02/08/2021 12:34:09
Hi, I was trying to do stuff with physics ODE plugin. I wonder is there any way to create solid object that doesn't physically interact with objects but still detects collision?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 12:34:48
Currently it is not possible to control multiple joints with the same motor, but this functionality is in our TODO list:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1365](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1365)

##### Park Jeong Woo 02/08/2021 12:34:57
ex) ball collides with box but box doesn't get pushed by the ball. Still collision is detected by the box.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 12:36:20
Yes, you should define the `boundingObject` field of a `Solid` node but not the `physics` field.

##### Park Jeong Woo 02/08/2021 12:37:00
I tried setting physics with null, but when I moved that object around, it still interacted with other objects.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 12:41:02
Ok, so you want to detect the collision to do your stuff but then let the physics engine ignoring it.

This is possible from the physics plugin `webots_physics_collide` function. If this function returns 1 or 2, then ODE will not handle the collision:

Windows 10

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 13:47:01
It would be helpful if you could open the Command Prompt, navigate to the Webots installation directory, type the following instructions and post the output:

```
cd msys64\mingw64\bin
webots.exe --sysinfo
```

##### bertlangton 02/08/2021 15:21:53
sure, here it is:



System: Windows 10 64-bit

Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6100U CPU @ 2.30GHz

Number of cores: 2

OpenGL vendor: ATI Technologies Inc. (0x1002)

OpenGL renderer: AMD Radeon (TM) R5 M430 (0x6660)

OpenGL version: 4.5.13469 Compatibility Profile Context 21.19.512.4

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 15:28:18
Did you try to update your graphics driver?

##### bertlangton 02/08/2021 15:38:29
Yup.


After that, it stayed open for a few seconds longer, but other than that it didn't help

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 15:47:52
The OpenGL version seems rather new. I'm checking in our telemetry database to see if other users could successfully run Webots with this OpenGL version and similar setup. But for the moment it seems that most of the users that enabled the telemetry are using older OpenGL versions (usually 3.3, for example `3.3.13596 Core Profile Forward-Compatible Context`)


Maybe it could also be an option to try to downgrade the drivers to check if it works.

##### Iris230 02/08/2021 16:05:00
thank you! It works😆

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 16:07:02
Thank you for reporting this bug! I updated the Webots Makefile and the fix will be included in the next release of Webots.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 16:50:00
You can include a USE of this DEF only at a lower position in the scene tree. Where are you trying to include a USE of it?

##### alejanpa17 02/08/2021 16:52:41
For example in this one
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/808379791899099136/unknown.png)
%end


I just found out that you can include a USE only upper the DEF (in the way closer to the root of the scene tree). So if it is at the same level is impossible?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 17:09:52
Yes, it should be possible at the same level, but the DEF has to come first (upper).


If you save your world file and search for the USE/DEF name, you should first find the DEF, then the USE.

##### alejanpa17 02/08/2021 17:26:24
Look, I have it the DEF there but the solids where I'm pointing It doesn't appear the USE

![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/808388279052533810/unknown.png)
%end


I think is kind of a bug because I did a boundingObject DEF of a Box for testing and It works with the solids under it, just like you said


Its happening when you have this type of structure of the boundingObject DEF: Group>>Transform>>Box
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/808396782168965120/unknown.png)
%end


You can try yourself

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/08/2021 19:29:02
`@alejanpa17` The DEF "test" node can only be used in `boundingObject` fields because this structure (without a `Shape` node between the `Transform` and the `Box` nodes) is a particular simplified structure not valid for graphical objects.

If you also want to use it outside the `boundingObject` to define the a graphical object, then I would suggest you to declare the DEF node for the graphical object and then the USE for the boundingObject.

##### alejanpa17 02/08/2021 20:40:19
Just found out this is working!! It turns out that you need a Shape node between Transform and Box node. Thank you!!

##### Adyasha 02/09/2021 06:51:52
Which sensor in webots can differentiate between colors?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/09/2021 07:04:37
A standard RGB camera.


Note: an infra-red distance sensor is also affected by colors of obstacles.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 07:05:39
if you just want a simple color sensor you can probably set the resolution to 1x1 pixels

##### Adyasha 02/09/2021 07:06:00
I want to differentiate between black and white paths in a line follower

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/09/2021 07:07:00
In that case, it is simpler and more efficient to use a DistanceSensor with type set to "infra-red". You will measure a larger value for the white and a lower value for the black.

##### Adyasha 02/09/2021 07:07:47
Somehow the reading of my infrared come just the opposite for white it is <1000 and for black it is 1000

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/09/2021 07:10:18
That may depend on the values set in lookupTable of the DistanceSensor.

##### Adyasha 02/09/2021 07:11:31
Ok thanks !


I need a bit of help with my line following algorithm

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:05:00
i have a question related to the camera that works as rgb


i try to use the camera to read rgb but i am not getting the write value


my camera is close to an ir sensor, deos this affect it?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/09/2021 09:07:09
No, it shouldn't.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 09:07:17
you can try to visualize the cameras viewframe using view->show optional renderings->show camera frustum


maybe you also need to start your camera [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb\_camera\_enable](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb_camera_enable)

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:09:41
i did use enable command


but i am reading the wrong value


is it possible to go on a audio call with anyone?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 09:10:45
did you try this?

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:10:56
doing it now


it doesnt make any difference


i am quite sure that there is an issue related  to code


def colour():

    #identify colour

    cam.enable(TIME\_STEP)

    cameraData = cam.getImage()

    # get the red component of the pixel (5,10)

    red = cam.imageGetRed(cameraData, cam.getWidth(), 1, 1)

    green = cam.imageGetGreen(cameraData, cam.getWidth(), 1, 1)

    blue = cam.imageGetBlue(cameraData, cam.getWidth(), 1, 1)

    # red = pixel[0]

    # green = pixel[1]

    # blue = pixel[2]

    cam.disable()

    return (red,green,blue)


this is the function to read the colour


but the camera most of the time reads a certain colour and only at some random moments it reads a couple of more colours

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 09:21:16
enable your camera once and then let it run, dont try to enable and disable it at every simulation step

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:22:47
compass = robot.getDevice('compass')

compass.enable(TIME\_STEP)


i have added these bits outside of the function

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 09:24:06
i think it takes one simulation step to get the image from the simulation into the frame buffer of the camera


to test you can put a step simulation between the cam.enable and the cam.getImage

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:27:46
how can i do this


and why does reads red when there is nothing red in front of the robot?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 09:33:09
```
simulation -> camera buffer -> your code
            1                2
```


1 only happens when you step the simulation


and you are therefore doing 2 before 1


and there might be anything in the camera buffer before it is properly initialized


that is the nature of RAM


it should be something like controller.step(TIME\_STEP)

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:40:16
i think i figured it out


when you click on the camera which is located at the children file of the robot


i moved the pink pyramid shape of the camera in the front and now it reads the right colour


what is actually the pink pyramid?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/09/2021 09:42:32
it is called the camera frustum


basically what the camera sees

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 09:42:45
ohhh


thank you! now it works perfectly and i get the rgb values


thank you!

##### nelsondmmg 02/09/2021 13:42:16
Hi, I'm would like to write a sh file that executes multiple webots simulations (sequentially), changing the arguments of the controllers used inside the simulation. Can I modify such parameters from the command line directly or do I need to modify the .wbt file before each execution? Also, is it possible to register videos from the simulation using the command line (if possible without opening the webots window). How can I automatize these simulations .In the documentation the "Starting webots" page only gives details about launching the application. Thanks.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/09/2021 13:44:16
`@nelsondmmg` you could use extern controllers and start those seperately, parsing arguments with python for example

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/09/2021 13:44:17
`@nelsondmmg` You can add a Supervisor node which changes the arguments and restarts the simulation. Same for videos, you can use the Supervisor node to record videos.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/09/2021 13:46:24
you can also load the world from a python script



> **Attachment**: [launch\_webots\_world.py](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/808695365048991764/launch_webots_world.py)

this will launch the world, and make the extern controller connect to the correct webots instance

##### nelsondmmg 02/09/2021 14:06:13
Ok, but since I'm already working with C++ I would like to use it instead of python (but it's nice to know that there is an alternative). Now, if I create a supervisor node to manage the simulation (keeping in mind that all the objects in the simulation are also supervisors, since everyone recovers the position from the others directly from the node) how can I launch the other controllers (reset the controllers and the simulation and change the arguments can be done using the supervisor functions, but I do not see a start function). Also, if there a way to known that a controller ended execution, or some sort of message needs to be sent to the supervisor ?

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 14:11:23
hello, i have a question realated to motors


i try to se their position but they do some funny moves


i think it might be an issue with the reference position

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/09/2021 14:12:57
`@nelsondmmg` If it is the same world and robots, just turn the controllers into extern controllers. After a reset or world load, the simulation will only start, if all extern controllers have been started. So you can just launch them with the specific args you want


`@popo74013` you have to give us more details than that. Perhaps show us your controller code and explain exactly what it is doing, and what it SHOULD do

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 14:17:07
i made a robot and i used 2 motors to control the gripping mechanisms


and once the robot moves and detects an object it is supposed to grip it


but when i set the motors' position at an angle, they move randomy


i think it is because they are not oriented correctly

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/09/2021 14:19:08
Make sure the axis of the jont is defined properly


also the anchor and 'translation' field of the endPoint Solid for each joint


usually you want them to be identical

##### popo74013 02/09/2021 14:20:09
ohhh, thank you


i will try it and i will let you know!

##### nelsondmmg 02/09/2021 14:21:50
Is there some documentation about extern controllers? Maybe is a new feature and I'm not familiarized, but since there is some dependency related to the control of objects in the code (in my case I need to initialize the driver object to control vehicles) I should not start these controllers outside webots and then attach then to the webots process.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/10/2021 10:03:53
Hello `@popo74013`, Yes, if you control the motor using `wb_motor_set_position` it acts as a servo.

##### popo74013 02/10/2021 10:04:15
grips = []

gripsNames = ['left\_motor', 'right\_motor']

for i in range(2):

    grips.append(robot.getDevice(gripsNames[i]))

    grips[i].setPosition(3.14/2)        

    grips[i].setVelocity(0.0)


i am writing in python but this doesnt seem to work

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 10:39:36
`@popo74013` dont set the velocity

##### popo74013 02/10/2021 10:39:56
ohh i think it works now


it was an issue in the design


the right grip was working fine but the left not


so i modified the right motor and beam to look like the left and now it works

##### bingdong 02/10/2021 11:52:53
Hi! New to Webots and Blender. As I understand both support python programming. But is it the case that python scripts can be used in blender to create animations and in Webots to build robot controllers? 

I found a simple legged robot blender file online which makes it move when a python script. When I exported it to Webots, the model doesn't move. I'm guessing that the same script won't work for controller? What can I do to make the robot move then?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 12:11:05
You will have to write a controller [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming)


<@&568329906048598039> Is there still separate animation functionality? Not sure about that

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/10/2021 12:17:40
No, Webots doesn't have any built-in functionality for animations.

For the moment the way to go is to write a controller program that reads the animation file and using the Supervisor API moves the different robot parts accordingly.

##### bingdong 02/10/2021 12:34:31
<@239507682111913984> `@Stefania Pedrazzi` Thanks for the guidance. I'll try it out!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/10/2021 13:13:31
You can, at the controller level, add an extra layer that will alter sensor data before passing then to your control algorithm. Also, in Webots, depending on the sensor, you can add different types of noise. See the specific sensor descriptions in the documentation to understand what kind of noise can be added.


Yes, you can use WorldInfo.inkEvaporation, see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo#worldinfo](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo#worldinfo)

##### samuel.nametala 02/10/2021 13:24:46

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:02:31
So i am using a physical kinect sensor and a simulated drone that is available in the webots software


So the drone is not physical


I want to develop a communication between the physical kinect sensor and the drone available in webots software

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:04:11
[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)


you can use emitter and receiver nodes in Webots


basically simulates radio communication

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:05:58
I see that so in my case i could send signals and use the kinect sensor to receive the nodes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:06:22
what exactly do you want to do?


send movement commands to the drone depending on what the kinect sees?

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:06:59
Yes exactly


Like that

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:07:17
then add a receiver to the drone, and an emitter to the kinect


both have to be defined as a robot. With a controller each

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:08:57
Just one more clarification the code for my kinect is written in C# and i have used visual community in windows so do i have to change my code into C++ to make it possible

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:09:46
I'm a python and ROS guy, so I dont know. But that seems right.


I'd recommend going through some of the documentation of Webots and having a look at some sample worlds, in order to get a better base understanding of Webots

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:11:02
Okay fair enough! But#bw to run the testing of the physical kinect using webots


To test ny gestures on a physical kinect sensor is it possible


?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:11:36
wait, do you want to simulate the kinect, or use the physical kinect to control the simulated drone?

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:11:54
Yes use the physical kinect to control the simulated drone

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:12:02
ohhhh okay, that is different


you're using the mavic2Pro in Webots?

Yes mavic 2 pro

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/10/2021 15:12:46
the default controller there is in c


you can take a look at it. You simply have to get your kinect data in there


how you do it, does not really matter


or you write your own in any of the supported languages

##### waleed 02/10/2021 15:14:29
Yes i have gone through the default controller snd the only part i dont get is how to get the kinect data in there

Why is it that the code run on my bot with my world runs differently on someone else's computer with same world and same bot ?

##### Chernayaten 02/10/2021 18:23:30
Differently how? If it's the speed then that's most likely due to difference in the CPU/GPU capabilities of your computers

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/11/2021 07:44:08
`@waleed` You want to send images from your physical Kinect to the simulated drone? In that case, you don't need C#-C/C++ communication, you can read the images directly in your C/C++ controller:

[https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~edzhang/tutorials/kinect2/kinect1.html](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~edzhang/tutorials/kinect2/kinect1.html)


In general, to write a controller in non-supported language, you can develop a third-party support like it is done for Haskell:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/HsWebots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/HsWebots)



or use TCP/IP:

##### nelsondmmg 02/11/2021 10:03:12

Am I doing something wrong

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/11/2021 10:47:29
In C++ you also need to print `std::endl` at the end of the log to flush the buffers.

[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/endl/](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/endl/)

##### Saud 02/11/2021 10:50:04
hmm right i thought that was mostly for a new line. just tried it. nothing

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 10:50:10
hello guys, I'm taking webots tutorial and I want to build my senior project using webots. I want to ask you if I can implement AI algorithms that can manipulate a robotic arm using a bayesian neural network that get the distination as an input and the output is the angles of the actuators of this arm. is this possible ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/11/2021 10:52:19
Are you running the simulation step-by-step? In this case the logs are currently printed one step later in the Webots console.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 10:53:22
it sounds like you want to teacha bayesian neural network to do inverse kinematics, is that correct?

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 10:53:40
exactly

##### waleed 02/11/2021 10:54:09
Hi — thanks for the help and i will look into it. But in my case i was going to do live gestures and in my opinion if i were to send images that would produce a lot error in controlling the simulated drone

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 10:55:05
you dont really need a simulation for that, you only need forward kinematics to get the error between the pose that the manipulator would be in if you applied the joint angels from the network and the pose you wanted it to be in

##### Saud 02/11/2021 10:55:19
yes but this is out of the while loop at the moment just to test. the actual thing i want to print is in the while loop. i put it out to see if it actually prints something out

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 10:56:34
what is the purpose of using a neural network rather than something like fastIK or trac\_ik

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 10:56:52
yes but I proposed the neural networks methods in my proposal for the project. fell like I'm in a real trouble 🥲

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/11/2021 10:57:59
It is tricky to do it within Webots because the simulation doesn't run until all the extern controllers are started. You may try to modify the world from your robot controller and check for the modification from the supervisor controller (for example setting the `Robot.customData` field).

It seems better to check which processes are running on the system using standard libraries (for example psutil for Python, etc.)

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 10:59:56
for inverse kinematics tasks neural networks usually dont work that well as far as i know, there is an evolutionary ik called bioIK that we use and works pretty well

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:00:16
I didn't get you dear

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/11/2021 11:00:34
Try to run it in realtime mode instead of step-by-step. In any case the instruction seems correct and it should work if you don't have other issues in your controller.

You can also check the C++ example in `projects/languages/cpp/worlds/example.wbt` where many messages are printed from the controllers.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:01:00
why do you want to use a neural network to solve the problem of inverse kinematics rather than an interative algorithm?

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:02:49
I can use anything that works, I want the robotic arm to reach a destination of a surface when it is detected using a smart camera

##### Saud 02/11/2021 11:02:57
sorry yes i mean that i am running it on realtime. and also i should say that i am using supervisor mode so i hope that doesn't make a difference

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:06:22
it is definitely possible to simulate a robotic arm and a regular rgb camera as well as a deph camera (maybe you can elaborate on what you mean by smart camera?)  in webots if that is what you meant to ask


but moving an arm from a to b is not as simple as it might seem, if you do jointspace interpolation, meaning just turn all the joints to the target position, you will have unexpected movements and possibly collision

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:09:42
iw webots I found a smart camera with object recognition, you can check it in the user manual


I will do my best to work

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:11:24
ah ok, just found the recognition node, did not know about that

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:11:39
called mobileye

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:16:17
i'm not sure that i understand your use case well enough, but I would recommend some motion planning framework such as moveit if you want to achive any complex movements

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:17:21
this is a software ?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:17:43
[https://moveit.ros.org/](https://moveit.ros.org/)

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:18:46
I'm also creating a 3D model using blender, would it work using moveit ?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:25:39
you need a urdf (basically a description of your robots kinematics) and a sdf (basically a semantic description of your robot) for moveit to work


how complex is your manipulator?

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:26:34
is 3 Degrees of Freedom an answer for your question ?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:28:04
then maybe moveit is a bit overkill, it depends on how complex your environment is but with only 3 DoF you can probably use some jointspace interpolation


i thought you had something like a 6 DoF robot arm

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:29:24
no it is only 3. anyway i had a look in moveit, it is very complicated as my first impression

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 11:30:26
yes it is quite complicated, but for more complex motion planning tasks with more degrees of freedom some motion planning framework is usually required

##### Mohannad Kassar 02/11/2021 11:32:59
I have 3 main algorithms in this project need to be implements, I'm thinking to make something on GitHub so maybe I can got some help if needed

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/11/2021 11:33:05
No, there is no difference if you use the Supervisor.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/11/2021 15:58:30
`@John520` you can give then a seperate contact material and decrease the soft\_cfm value


you can also decrease the cfm value of the whole world, but collisions might become "too hard"

##### John520 02/11/2021 16:10:41
`@Simon Steinmann` Thank you for your direction. I added a contact material for TruckWheels before. Would it be similar to add one for the potted tree?

By the way, why it does not work if the material2 is "TruckWheel"?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/11/2021 16:15:02
what does not work?


and yes, would be the same


you can add as many contact properties as you like

##### John520 02/11/2021 16:32:39
`@Simon Steinmann`. Oh, I added a truck and a contact property for it. The truck will sink a bit into the floor if the material2 is "TruckWheel".


But if the material2 is "TruckWheels", the truck will not sink and it looks very good.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/11/2021 16:37:32
contact properties adjust the interaction between 2 contact materials


so it depends on what material you have in your wheels

##### John520 02/11/2021 16:47:38
Thank you `@Simon Steinmann`. Should I check the Proto file to know what the material it is?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/11/2021 17:01:37
in the scene tree, just change the contactmaterial name of your wheels

##### John520 02/11/2021 17:19:08
Thank you very much. I found the contactMaterial name of the truck in the TruckWheel.proto.


But I could not find the contactMaterial name of the PottedTree.proto. Please see [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/projects/objects/plants/protos/PottedTree.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/projects/objects/plants/protos/PottedTree.proto)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/11/2021 17:22:26
you could convert it to basenodes and add it yourself


or you edit the proto


if something is not included, it uses the default values

##### John520 02/11/2021 17:27:42
Thank you very much for your help! It works!


Is there a setting in the PottedTree to allow a truck to go through it? It is like a tractor going through in the crop field.

##### John520 02/11/2021 17:52:32
Thank you `@Simon Steinmann` . I first convert the PottedTree to the base node and then reset its boundingObject Group to default value. But the PottedTree will sink and disappear under the floor.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/11/2021 17:53:22

##### bellino 02/11/2021 22:44:42
Has anyone here ever set up an extern controller and run it as a ROS node? I've set up both ROS and webots and installed ros-noetic-webots-ros but it keeps throwing an error at the first line (an import statement) of my python file

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 22:45:37
you probably need to set your environment variables correctly


we use this: [https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang\_robot/blob/master/wolfgang\_webots\_sim/scripts/setenvs.sh](https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang_robot/blob/master/wolfgang_webots_sim/scripts/setenvs.sh)


then just `source setenvs.sh` and try to start your controller in the same terminal

##### bellino 02/11/2021 22:49:03
hm I have set most of them, I put them in my .bashrc file, except what's on line 5. What does that do exactly?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 22:49:35
dont really know to be honest


what exactly fails to import?

##### bellino 02/11/2021 22:50:12
Also, I just put my files in src in my catkin\_ws and I start the node using rosrun packagename filename (as opposed to roslaunch webots\_ros and so on, like they do in the docs)


this is the error message I get: line 1: import: command not foundfrom: can't read /var/mail/controllers


so I guess it is the import statement itself?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 22:51:29
you forgot your shebang


add this as the first line of your code


`#!/usr/bin/env python3`

##### bellino 02/11/2021 22:53:20
ooh nice, now it just tells me that it doesn't know controller, which is what I first had when my environment variables were set up wrongly. Thank you!

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 22:54:20
but you know how to fix it?

##### bellino 02/11/2021 22:56:14
okay I take back what I said, this is not the same error because running the external controller outside of ROS still works

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 22:57:00
can you start your controller using `python controller.py`


without rosrun

##### bellino 02/11/2021 22:57:37
yep, that works just fine

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/11/2021 22:58:48
we start our ros controller for webots using a shell script: [https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang\_robot/blob/master/wolfgang\_webots\_sim/scripts/start.sh](https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang_robot/blob/master/wolfgang_webots_sim/scripts/start.sh)


which is called in a launch file


basically only line 8 in [https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang\_robot/blob/master/wolfgang\_webots\_sim/launch/simulation.launch](https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang_robot/blob/master/wolfgang_webots_sim/launch/simulation.launch)

##### bellino 02/11/2021 23:00:25
thank you, I will take a look!


just as a little fyi and also because I cannot help shaking my head, there was no problem... the import that failed was from a file of mine that was in a folder called controllers. Thank you `@jasper` for your help!

Hi, I have a question about the usega of extern controllers. During a simulation the step is executed only after all robots executed the step() function. How can I make a simulation continue if one of these extern controller finished its execution (and therefore does not execute step() anymore)? 

EDIT: Just found out that I just needed to set synchronization to false (but the pedestrians in my version, 2020a, did not have this attribute so I created).

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/12/2021 14:54:59
Did you run the youbot demo distributed with Webots? The source code of the controller shows you how to make all these movements, including the side movement. Also, when the demo is over, you should be able to control the robot from the keyboard on all these motions.

Can there be a feature added in Webots that can make a drop-down wherever we declare a function or write if-elif-else anywhere in the code so that we can minimize it by pulling it up with the arrow, if we dont need to see it that much.

This will surely decrease the time to scroll up & down, and is also found in most editors.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/13/2021 16:56:12
`@Saud` you initialize the robot class, and then the supervisor. The supervisor has all the robot functionality plus extra supervisor ones. So when your robot is a supervisor, don't use robot. Only use supervisor. You can use it in the very same wa as the robot


You can keep the same variable name as before, so you only need to change line 32 and not the rest of your code


`@vinwan` have you checked the documentation mentioned in the error message? And are the newest graphics drivers installed for your gpu?


`@Adyasha` I'll answer here, as it seems more like a technical question. Of course you can set the speed higher, but for very hogg speeds you mat have to lower the basic timestep. If you are at 32ms, that's about 30 steps per second. Can you provide more info? What error are you getting? Are you using velocity or position control? What are the parameters of your motor?

##### vinwan 02/13/2021 17:22:13
`@Simon Steinmann` this was attempted with safe mode in both 2019 version and 2021Ra both had the same outcome . This error message is from the 2019 version . This computer is core i5 2nd generation without a dedicated gpu. I understand that this computer doesnt have the required openGL drivers  but webots is running on intel 3rd generation computers perfectly soo can there be a way to work this out?


`@Simon Steinmann` I think an older version of webots such as webots 8,7 will work but unfortunately those require licensing . This not for me this for a few high school students im teaching webots to

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/13/2021 17:28:29
Problem is, that 2nd gen Intel integrated gpus only support opengl 3.1,nit 3.2


Perhaps look for a dirt cheap low end dedicated gpu?


<@&568329906048598039> this is not my expertise, but is it possible to run webots somehow with opengl3. 1?  I think docker uses CPU graphics

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/13/2021 17:31:57
No, it's a no go unfortunately.


Webots in CI uses software rendering (super slow). It might be possible to replace your Windows OpenGL libraries with some software only rendering, i.e., Mesa, but I have no experience with this and the performance will be very low.

- Try this: [https://dhern023.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/update-intel-sandy-bridge-opengl-compatibility-to-3-3/](https://dhern023.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/update-intel-sandy-bridge-opengl-compatibility-to-3-3/)

- Install Linux on the laptop and use Webots from Linux.


But in any case, you will get a slow performance (you should probably disable all advanced OpenGL features from the Webots preferences).

Thank you will look into this

##### Vangiel 02/14/2021 10:11:39
Hello everyone, I am quite new in Webots and I am having a problem I cannot solve. I load a world with just the basic nodes and a supervisor robot. From the controller of that robot I load elements to the scenario using the python api (pedestrians, floor, robot, objects...). My problem is that when I reset the simulation all the nodes I added disappear but some of them remain (like the floor and one of the pedestrians). How can I do a clean reset? I have tried to use supervisor.worldReload but the world keep reloading all the time. I hope you can help me, thanks.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/14/2021 10:13:10
Make sure that you save the world after you have added all the nodes


There also is a difference between resetting the world and reloading it.

##### Vangiel 02/14/2021 10:17:10
The problem with saving the world after I add the nodes is that it will save all of it in the wbt file right? and I want to load random scenarios each time

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/14/2021 16:14:29
`@Vangiel` what exactly do you want to happen? Remove everything? World reload seems like the easiest clean option. I'm not sure what exactly doesn't work for you there. Otherwise, you could simply remove all the nodes using the supervisor api


Then do a simulation reset


Feel free to pm me, I can take a look. Kinda curious about your project. Worked on domain randomization before, but not randomized environments

##### Qwerty23 02/14/2021 20:07:37
`@Simon Steinmann` Was wondering on how to move the Robotis OP2's arms in terms of Pitch, Yaw, and Roll, to let the robots arm close in, python


controlling it individually

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/15/2021 08:04:47
The reset feature is documented here:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu)

(scroll to `Note: In order to reset...`)



However, according to your description it seems that the reset doesn't work properly. Could you please open an issue with a minimal example:

##### Siliconlad 02/15/2021 08:05:43
Good morning! I'm currently trying to create an external C++  ROS noetic controllers for our robot. So in my `.cpp` file I have include statements of the form `#include "webots/Robot.hpp"` alongside ROS include statements like `#include "ros/ros.h"`. Is there a way to link the webots cpp api using CMake so that I can run `catkin build` in my workspace and then just run the controllers (using `rosrun` or via a launch file) and have them connect to the simulator?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/15/2021 10:03:56
Here is a CMake example for ROS 2, but for ROS 1 should be very similar:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/5af9fe3b25e4f5be9b584b4e64f62078b063eaad/webots\_ros2\_cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L17-L26](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/5af9fe3b25e4f5be9b584b4e64f62078b063eaad/webots_ros2_cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L17-L26)



Note: Make sure the `WEBOTS_HOME` environment variable is configured.

Your class `TeleopRobot` looks good, but maybe I am missing something. I would suggest to you to try rebuilding your controller from the example I sent to you

##### Tahir [Moderator] 02/15/2021 13:59:27
I've got things working but don't know whats happening and what was wrong. 

The script which I've uploaded `teleop_robot.py` worked when I just added(`rospy.loginfo("")` before `self.sendWheelVelocitties(self.left_wheel_velocity, self.right_wheel_velocity)`)

In this part the real working is happening where I am sending the commands to the robot to move. Before adding the above `rospy.loginfo` there was no movement but after adding its working fine both in form of a ros package as `@Darko Lukić`  suggested with above mentioned example package and the standalone controller in `Robot controller` field.


I know `rospy.loginfo` is triggering something but what that I am not able to understand

Hey guys, quick question, is there any way I can add a parameter of downforce to a car?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/15/2021 16:32:17
No, but you can simulate it. You can use `wb_supervisor_node_get_velocity` ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_velocity](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_velocity)) to get car's velocity and `wb_supervisor_node_add_force` ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)) to apply the downforce as a function of the velocity.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/16/2021 10:21:12
1. You check that every `WbNodeRef` and `WbFieldRef` you retrieve is not NULL.

2. It's a bad idea to use `Box` for a DEF name as it is a reserved VRML keyword for the `Box` node.

3. Instead of changing  the `scale` field of a `Solid` node, I would suggest you to change the `size` field of the `Box` node.

4. The `baseColor` is not a field of a `Solid` node: you should get it from a `PRBAppearance` node instead.

##### Steven37 02/16/2021 10:47:54

How can I run webots in the background to be used for functional testing? I could not find any command line arguments. Maybe some environment variable?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/16/2021 12:34:42
You should use the `--batch` command line option.

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 02/16/2021 12:35:16
but it still starts a window. Can we run it without window at all? or do I need to use framebuffer and co

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/16/2021 12:36:53
You may add the `--minimize` command line option to have the window minimized at startup. It is not possible to avoid the creation of the window because Webots need to be connected to the OpenGL context via a window.


On Linux you can use a virtual framebuffer to avoid completely showing-up any window.

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 02/16/2021 12:37:54
OK. My goal was to use webots on gitlab/github CI. So then I probably need to set up some fake display


ja exactly. I will try. thanks

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/16/2021 12:43:19
You can either make that the robot will not actually quit, but execute `wb_robot_step()` in an endless loop, or you could simply replace the robot controller with an empty or void controller from a supervisor program.

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 02/16/2021 12:45:47
ahah. Last comment, made me think I need a way to stop webots if I make it run in the background. We use an external controller and that one will finish, but we need to stop webots too. Can we make webots quit from the external controller using some supervisor command?

you know we are the strange guys using webots without physics 😉

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/16/2021 12:47:05

Hello all, this may be a trivial question but I have been stuck since yesterday. I want to use ros2 due to the nav2 package but with webots as my simulator. I am struggling to figure out how to exactly use this package because I suppose I need to use different topics like cmd\_vel to publish speed etc. to. Does this package only tell me by how much to rotate my robot/ where to go or can it handle the actual joint movement?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/16/2021 19:03:02
Have you checked `webots_ros2_turtlebot`:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/tree/master/webots\_ros2\_turtlebot](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/tree/master/webots_ros2_turtlebot)



It implements support for navigation:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Navigate-TurtleBot3](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Navigate-TurtleBot3)

##### bellino 02/16/2021 21:00:43
thank you! I also have another question. My robot has two wheels with a motor and one wheel for stabilization, I am turning by rotating the wheels in the opposite direction and using position sensors to track by how far each wheel has rotated, but the rotation is not exact. For instance, when I want to rotate by pi/2, I rotate by 1.58 instead. Is there a better way to deal with this?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/16/2021 21:33:37
You probably need to calibrate the axle length and wheel radius. Try with different values until you get a more accurate rotation.



However, if you robot is aware it got rotated by 1.58 then you have problem with the control, you need calibrate PID coefficients.



In general, error of 0.01 radians is not bad.

##### bellino 02/16/2021 21:41:58
right, I suppose it's very difficult to get 100% accurate rotations

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/16/2021 21:50:44
Hi, I'm following the examples to use moveit in [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/released/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/released/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots). 

This includes the following:

```
from controller import Robot
robot = Robot()
```

using python 2.7. But when instantiating the Robot() the script simply terminates without any error messages. Any help appreciated. My pythonpath and ld\_library\_path should be set (the import succeeds) and include `/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python27` and `${WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller` respectively

`

##### bellino 02/16/2021 23:36:21
Okay I followed the driver tutorial here [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-Write-ROS2-Driver](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-Write-ROS2-Driver) and I think it works so far but I am not sure where I would put the code that actually moves the joints. I can't seem to find where that's in the turtlebot repo. Where would the controller be specified and how does it interact with the driver. From my understanding, the driver is the interface between ros2 and webots publishing webots data for ros2, correct?


Okay a little edit, I am now using WebotsDifferentialDriveNode and it says an external controller has been started. How would I go about actually moving the robot now? Do I have to publish something to some topic?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 07:42:39
Hello Daniel, that sounds as a good approach. Can you run a Python2 controller from Webots UI? Make sure `Tools > Preferences > Python command` is set to `python2`


Yes, see this:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-E-puck-for-ROS2-Beginners#velocity-control](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-E-puck-for-ROS2-Beginners#velocity-control)



Also, you can use `teleop_twist_keyboard`

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/17/2021 08:04:13
This does seem to work in the webots UI itself


Looking at the environment variables set in the UI, there are numerous webots variables. Defining WEBOTS\_TMP\_PATH and WEBOTS\_SERVER I now at least get an error message from running `Robot()`. But copying the values from the UI won't work as they refer to tmp paths. Is there a guide somewhere which of these and how I have to set them?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 09:16:18
What you did is enough to run an external controller:

```
export PYTHONPATH=${WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller/python27
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```



Furthermore, those environment variables are automatically configured:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/4027aa8c7ef7c0a7f4dd0692fdf89437cd99546f/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots/launch/ur\_controller.launch#L4-L5](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/4027aa8c7ef7c0a7f4dd0692fdf89437cd99546f/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots/launch/ur_controller.launch#L4-L5)



So you don't need configure them manually.



I am trying to reproduce your problem, but it works fine for me with Noetic (I don't have Melodic)

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/17/2021 09:26:23
Hmm. Outside of the webots UI it's as simple as running robot=Robot()  for me and the python shell immediately terminates. Happens in both python2.7 and python3. I'm using ros melodic. Maybe I'm missing a step that would configure these things when not using the webots UI? I actually don't think it is related to ROS

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 09:37:47
If you run only `robot = Robot()` the controller exists as there is no more things to do. You have have to add something like: `while robot.step(32) != -1: pass` to make it run.



If your controller crashes the problem is most likely in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Try to print it in the controller running from UI and the external controller to see whether it clashes with some other shared library.

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/17/2021 10:33:31
I have now set it to exactly `PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python27` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/webots/lib/controller`, so nothing else in those paths and still the same thing happens


In the UI I have this path: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /home/honerkam/Downloads/my_project/controllers/my_controller:/tmp/webots-26335-Ic2kFC//lib;/opt/ros/melodic/lib;/opt/ros/melodic/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu;/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64;/home/honerkam/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin;/usr/local/webots/lib/controller`. So the main difference in there is this tmp path `/tmp/webots-26335-Ic2kFC/`, but I assume I don't have to set this manually


And again, if I do define these two WEBOTS\_TMP\_PATH and WEBOTS\_SERVER I at least get an error about the server path being wrong. But I don't know if that means that I got further or less far in instantiating the Robot()

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 10:40:11
Are you sure the controller is crashing? Maybe it simply finished.

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/17/2021 10:41:05
I'm just running a python shell at this point:

$python

>>from controller import Robot()

>>robot=Robot()

and then the python shell crashed

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 10:41:26
In your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH you are using `;` and `:` as separator. I am not sure you can use `;`, it is usually `:`


But since you are overriding `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` it shouldn't make a difference

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/17/2021 10:42:18
This is the path that it prints out in the webots UI where it works, not the one on my shell

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 11:00:57
It is really strange. Just to confirm a few things. You use Ubuntu 18.04 and you installed Webots R2021a from a Debian package? The `python` command comes from Ubuntu, not from Conda or similar?



1. Try creating a simple external C controller. If it crashes with no additional info then go to 2.

2. Compile Webots from source in debug mode: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation)

##### Daniel Honerkamp 02/17/2021 11:08:29
Ubuntu18.01, webots R202a installed through apt-get. Python is the system python27 interpreter


I was kind of hoping not to have to do that. I will have to see if I find time for that later this week


And there are really not other steps I'm missing than this to be configured correctly?

1. start a webots world with the robot

2. set paths

3. start a python console

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/17/2021 11:15:00
The robot in the world has to have the  `controller` field equal to `<extern>`


Otherwise it looks good


If I get some idea why it doesn't work I will let you know

##### Steven37 02/17/2021 11:17:27
I am trying to get familiar with the camera in webots but I am wondering is there any function where I can get the width, height and color of only the recognized object from the camera instead of the image as a whole?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/17/2021 11:30:46
You should probably use the recognition module of the camera device, see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb\_camera\_recognition\_enable](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb_camera_recognition_enable)

##### Steven37 02/17/2021 11:50:02
`@Olivier Michel` thank you!


I want to ask again to make sure my code is correct for me to know the colors of the object I want in the camera?

%end


Because I'm not sure if the wb\_camera\_get\_width and wb\_camera\_get\_height functions will take the width and height of the whole image or is it just the recognised object?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 02/17/2021 12:15:34
The code is wrong because the `wb_camera_recognition_get_object` function doesn't return an image but a list of objects (`WbCameraRecognitionObjects`):

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#camera-recognition-object](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#camera-recognition-object)


You can find an example in the `projects/samples/devices/worlds/camera_recognition.wbt` simulation.

Seems this is where I was going wrong. It wasn't clear to methat instantiating a Robot() object equates to having an external controller and instead used the `ros` controller in webots. With <external> I get it to work. (Might be helpful to add some check to the Robot() initialiser in case that's possible). Thanks for the help

Hello everyone ! 



I would like to import a 3D model and define it as collision zones for my robot. However, I would like to define this model as one shape/solid/form. 



Currently, when I import a 3D model, I get a multitude of Nodes (Transform, Solid, Shape, Group, etc) distinct from each other. So, I don't want to retrieve the ID of the respective boundingObjects of each of these shapes to compare them with my robot's boundingObject, that would be way too long...



So is there a way to merge each of these shapes of the 3D model (mesh?) In order to get only one object, with a single ID?



Thank you in advance !

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/19/2021 08:12:10
Yes can either merge these object using a 3D modeling software, like Blender, or put them all together inside a Group node.

##### h.sciascia 02/19/2021 08:14:04
Ok I will try that, because I want only one boundingObject

##### bellino 02/19/2021 18:19:32
Hello I have two questions, first of all, is it somehow possible to get a body's rotation in the world the way it's shown in the scene tree? (I.e. without using sensors) Also, I am trying to implement rotation for my robot using wheel encoders but I found that it is not very accurate (i.e. when turning by pi the closest values I have gotten are 1.56999 and 1.581). I tried playing around with the axle length and wheel radius but this is as close as I have gotten. The robot has two wheels and rotates by spinning the wheels in opposite directions.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/19/2021 19:32:54
There is some documentation on how to do that here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers#single-simulation-and-multiple-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers#single-simulation-and-multiple-extern-robot-controllers)


it is not quite clear to me what your question is. What launch files are you talking about? ROS launch files?


to get the position and orientation of nodes in world coordinates you need to use a supervisor controller (see here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor))  you can make the controller that is turning your robot into a supervisor controller by replacing the creation of your Robot by a creation of a Supervisor object (Supervisor inherits from robot so all functions should still work)

then you can call `getSelf()` (or the equivalent in the programming language of your choice) to get the robot node. On the robot node you can get the translation and rotation field using `getField("translation")` or `getField("rotation")`.  on the translation field you want to call `getSFVec3f()` to get an array of coordinates, on the rotation field you want to call `getSFRotation()` to get an array representing a rotation in the axis angle notation

##### bellino 02/19/2021 20:28:24
what about the rotation, it is even possible to have an 100% accurate rotation?

##### JMarple 02/19/2021 20:33:03
Hello all, 



I have a PROTO file with a `robot` that contains a set of 8 identical `robot` from another PROTO file.  I have a controller on the highest level robot and want to access the motors on each of the 8 identical robots.  Normally this would be done using `getDevice`, however at the highest level robot, `robot.getNumberOfDevices()` returns 0.  



Is there a proper way to go about this?  I also tried to adding a device parameter to my PROTO and explicitly defining a device list at the highest level, but I still can't seem to get access to this. 



For reference, this is what the topology roughly looks like: 

```
- Robot
  - controller
  - children
    - Robot slot0
       - HingeJoint
    - Robot slot1
       - HingeJoint
    - Robot slot2
       - HingeJoint
    - etc.etc
```

 

Thanks

##### Chernayaten 02/19/2021 20:55:43
`@bellino`  I recently programmed a two-wheeled robot that rotates on its axis. There's a formula for the calculation you want which takes the base of the rotation as the distance between the center of the wheels. What I found out, and a member of this server helped me confirm, is that the distance of the outside part of the wheel is more accurate. 



However it was still not enough. Say I do a 90 degree turn a bunch of times, I will eventually be (visibly) off course. This problem becomes even worse when trying to do different angles (presumably, a 45 degree turn is half the 90 degree, but this was far from true for me). 



I tried playing around by slowly increasing/decreasing the rotation amount and it works to an extend, if you want to do a couple angles only it may be worth trying.



Your best solution would be to use the supervisor to change the angle (or for a more realistic turn, let the robot rotate and when it is "done", set it to the correct angle, essentially fixing the small mistakes that happen)

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/19/2021 21:01:04
what you are essentially doing is called dead reckoning ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead\_reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning)) and it is inaccurate in simulation as well as in the real world. In simulation it can be caused by a variety of factors such as numerical inaccuracies or explicitly injected noise in the simulated sensor data and many others. In the real world it is cause by wheel slippage, which almost always occurs. 

I am not sure how much wheel slippage occurs in simulation as well but I imagine it does. Maybe someone can correct me here or give some further information?


what is normally done in robotics is to have some kind of localization system such as SLAM or AMCL. The localization is normally based on the odometry (that is the pose the robot based on the turning of the wheels) and some sensor such as a Lidar or a camera


the solution proposed by `@Chernayaten` can work, but depending on the context might be considered "cheating"


The robot node is derived from Solid and not from Device, therefore it is not returned by getDevice


where did you get the idea to put multiple robot nodes in a single proto file, i have not seen that before

##### JMarple 02/19/2021 21:13:23
In real life, I have 8 motors on 8 different devices which are controlled by one controller.  My hope is instead of having to copy/paste 8 proto files into one massive file, I can re-use them.  Additionally, it'll more closely mimic how the system is architected IRL.

##### bellino 02/19/2021 21:14:54
I am building the robot for one of my university courses, so I don't think I should be using the supervisor for this. I think I will have to go with SLAM in this case (was trying to avoid it in order to keep it as simple as possible). Thank you very much for the information, I will probably come back once I have read more about the topic!

##### JMarple 02/19/2021 21:21:51
Oop I had a bit of a breakthrough, I changed the topology to:

```
- Robot
  - controller
  - children
    - Solid slot0
       - HingeJoint
    - Solid slot1
       - HingeJoint
    - Solid slot2
       - HingeJoint
    - etc.etc
```

And I'm getting some devices back.  Don't know which is which yet, but I'm sure I can figure that out. Thanks!

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 21:24:59
Hi guys im making a rover and have tried to implement wheel turning through hinge joints perpendicular to my wheel planes. When suspending the rover in air the wheels turn and respond to the position change in the coding but when moving the rover along the floor the wheels dont turn, implying theres a confliction between the wheels and the floor. Is there any settings i can alter to fix this? Thanks


I feel like it has something to do with the wheels sinking into the floor but not sure

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/19/2021 21:27:43
another option you have is to have 8 separate robots with a controller each and combine these in some master controller


you can try comparing your proto to the one of a different wheeled robot such as the pioneer [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/adept/pioneer2/protos/Pioneer2.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/adept/pioneer2/protos/Pioneer2.proto)

##### Chernayaten 02/19/2021 21:44:33
Yeah, I quickly came to the conclusion that accuracy is a fickle thing for what I wanted to do. 



The default noise value is 0, which ofc can be changed. You can set ContactProperties which have fields such as coulombFriction and forceDependentSlip which should introduce some slippage, but I never tried them out cause it was not necessary for my needs.

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 21:52:54
Hi thanks for the suggestion. The main difference i can see is the pioneer just uses the one set of hinge joints for wheels to turn, and then uses wheel PositionSensors in the joint device section. I dont have this setup as I have a hinge joint allowing turning movement for the wheels , and then a wheel hingejoint connected to this for wheel spinning. (Similar to sojourner proto in nasa files)


Yet i cannot see what the sojourner proto does much different to my model, The main difference i do observe is that my wheels sink into the surface

##### Chernayaten 02/19/2021 21:53:52
For PROTO nodes you should be able to use **wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_proto\_def** by giving DEF names to your nodes.


I would second jgueldenstein's suggestion to use 8 separate robots though


proto files are made to be re-used so why would you have to copy-paste them?

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 22:14:06
Has anyone had any experience with wheels sinking into the surface and better yet how to fix it?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/19/2021 22:19:18
you can reduce the basicTimeStep in the worldinfo node and/or reduce the softCFM in the contact properties

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 22:20:14
Ive set the timestep to 4 but no avail , softCFM?


changed CFM from 1e-5 -> 1e-10 didnt seem to work

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/19/2021 22:22:22

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 22:25:08
No luck but im not even sure i have contact properties set up correctly

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/19/2021 22:31:22
also doublecheck you didn't add very heavy parts by mistake (by setting a wrong density/mass or things like that)

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 22:33:41
I havent actually defined any of the masses yet just all parts set to the default density of 1000


Is that a problem?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/19/2021 22:34:33
if you have a bounding object and a density, it automatically calculates the mass

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/19/2021 22:37:08
That's normal, isn't that then unless it's a huge robot

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 22:44:13
Um id say its about 2.5m length 2m width 1m height


1m width 2m height*

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/19/2021 22:46:51
well, that makes your robot 2.5 * 1* 2 * 1000kg = 5000 kg heavy


just to test, try to set the density to 1

##### cooolwhip14 02/19/2021 22:48:37
When im next on my pc il give it a try and let you know. Cheers!


And is that to set the density of each bounding object i have on my rover to 1?


Nvm yes it would be

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/19/2021 22:50:22
you have basically two options, either you set the density to something that is realistic or you set the mass to something that is realistic. I think its generally easier to estimate the mass of each component than the density


if you set the mass you should set the density to -1, see here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics#field-summary)

##### cooolwhip14 02/20/2021 06:23:40

A graphic card is required ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/22/2021 09:49:22
It is not required, but it will boost performance, especially if you use LiDARs, cameras, range finders and similar

##### h.sciascia 02/22/2021 09:49:39
Ok thanks a lot ! 🙂


Ok it's working (for a really small basic STL exemple) using the option "using mesh for boundingObject" during the import process

##### Grassboi 02/22/2021 11:49:02
Hi, I just downloaded webots and the UI is really small.


I am on Linux and I have a 4k screen


Can you guys tell me how I can scale the UI properly? I have had a look in the docs but couldn't find anything.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/22/2021 12:36:33
Check this:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2631](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2631)


You can either download the nightly build:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_19\_2\_2021](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_19_2_2021)



or set the environment variable:

```
QT_ENABLE_HIGHDPI_SCALING = 1
```

Hi guys for ultrasonic sensors, in the actual code, is there a way of editing the angle range at which rays will be returned from 45 to something else?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/22/2021 14:19:33
Do you want to change the `DistanceSensor.aperture` value at run-time?

##### cindy 02/22/2021 14:19:59
Yes, basically. Because we need to detect lots of small objects from a distance

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/22/2021 14:20:18
But if you change it in the model, wouldn't that be sufficient?

##### cindy 02/22/2021 14:21:00
Ah how do you do that


I have not got much webots experience sadly

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/22/2021 14:21:30
See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)

Oh right aperture

##### Chernayaten 02/22/2021 14:22:43
From the Scene Tree (on the left most likely), go to your Robot, find the distance sensor and then edit the field

thank you

##### h.sciascia 02/22/2021 15:46:14
Hello again ! 

Do you know if there is a way to convert an URDF file to a 3D model file (obj, stl or other) ?

I want to use this model as my boundingObject because i do not have a mesh file included to my urdf model..

What do you think? I do not find an answer on the web

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 15:48:52
a urdf file does not contain any 3D model definitions itself


it just defines, how links are connected through joints


what exactly do you want to achieve?


there is always this converter: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)


it converts urdf files into proto files, which you can directly load into Webots. May I ask, which urdf file you want to convert?

##### h.sciascia 02/22/2021 15:52:12
I want to find a way to "resolve"/get around this issue [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2584](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2584)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 15:55:13
I'm not sure how your urdf comes into play here


you can use the shapes of your model as your bounding objects

##### h.sciascia 02/22/2021 15:56:54
Not for boundingObject Group nodes..

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 15:57:37
share your world file (project dir) and urdf pls


you can pm me if you dont wanna post public

##### h.sciascia 02/22/2021 16:00:54
Ok I send you a pm in the evening

 `@Darko Lukić` must see what i mean

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 16:21:59
I dont quite understand the issue to be honest

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 17:22:49
I am using a Pioneer robot with a camera attached to take a picture of the trees on the sides like in the video. Then I want it to print out some of the characteristics of those trees but nothing is printed. I have successfully tried with one tree, but it didn't work when I put several trees at the same time like that. Can someone tell me why, please? Thank you!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 17:23:43
Perhaps is something as simple as the trees not having unique names

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 17:23:47
Also, here's my code to print it out. I can still print "Hello World" but there are problems with my camera somewhere.

Is there any problem?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 17:40:12
I have never used this functionality


can you share your project? I can take a look


you can pm me


ohhh


you only execute the while loop AFTER you moved forward and then stopped


You should run that loop while you are moving

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 17:43:26
how can I?


I have successfully tried with one tree before

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 17:44:29
just set the velocities and then execute the while loop


you can have an if statement in the loop, that aborts it or sets the speed to 0 after a certain time

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 17:48:48
I removed the stop section but still didn't work

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 17:49:11
the 140*timestep is the issue

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 17:49:12
how can I share my project to you?


Why?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 17:49:27
just zip the project folder


well you execute 140 timesteps, BEFORE you start your object recognition

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 17:55:11
I have changed it but still the same

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 17:55:27

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 18:03:32
of course this does not work


you are executing all the movement BEFORE you start your loop


dont execute robot steps outside of your loop

still the same when i put those code into the loop

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 18:07:04
show me that code

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 18:08:08
i just cut all the movement code above and paste them inside the while loop

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 18:08:20
dont call the timestep


that is your issue


you tell it to just exectue 9 seconds of simulation without doing anything

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 18:08:42
yes, i have changed it as wll


as well

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/22/2021 18:09:07
works perfectly for me

as I said. removed all the extra robot steps

##### Steven37 02/22/2021 18:16:45
So if I don't just go straight now but I want my robot to turn at some points, what can I do? I think I must use wb\_robot\_step () to do that.

I added an example for stopping after 8 seconds


this is probably a cleaner solution

##### SeanLuTW 02/23/2021 04:51:30
How can I set the initial joints' angle in my UR5e PROTO correctly? I added six float fields in the built-in UR5e PROTO file and imported it to my world. I set these joints to the values I wanted and everything seems all right. After reloaded the world, the arm recovered to the original pose while the position sensors reported the value I had set.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 09:54:40
If you open your world file in a text editor, there should be a list of items similar to `hidden rotation_1 0 0 1 2.4306877183167175e-01`, you can modify the parameter to the desired initial position


there might be an easier way to do it though 😄


I also have a question. I am looking to adjust the maximum velocity of a motor from my (non supervisor) controller. I had the idea to export the field from the proto, but this a) requires a supervisor and b) does not work without reloading the model. Does anybody have an idea? I am basically looking for an alternative to the function setMaxVelocity() (which does not exist)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 10:09:50
Are you applying position, velocity or force control?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 10:10:01
position control

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 10:15:58
Did you try to use `wb_motor_set_velocity` followed by `wb_motor_set_position`? Does it take the specified velocity to achieve the requested position?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 10:16:17
I'll test it


That seems to work, I assumed, that `wb_motor_set_velocity` was only for velocity control, but it seems as they are used as upper limits according to ` The current values for velocity, acceleration and motor torque/force are taken into account.` here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#wb\_motor\_set\_velocity](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#wb_motor_set_velocity)


thank you for your help `@Olivier Michel`

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 10:23:37
I believe it is clear also from this table: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#force-and-torque-control](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#force-and-torque-control)

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 10:25:59

##### Harris 02/23/2021 12:14:47
Hi, I am pretty new to webots. I am wondering if there's anyway to transfer list type data from a supervisor to a robot controller in Python? I use emmitter/reciever function(emmitter.send) but can only transfer string, thank you lol.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 12:20:59
`recognitionColors` is not meant for that: it is to assign a color to each object so that the object gets segmented with that color. If you want to recognize the color of the cube, you should read the pixels of the camera image instead.


You could serialize your data into a string and use the Emitter/Receiver. Otherwise, you can use any IPC (Inter Process Communication) system or possibly simply a file shared between your robot and supervisor and synchronize the access to it with Emitter/Receiver messages.

Hi guys, I'd like to import a CAD vehicle model into Webots. I am happy that the latest Webots release already supports the direct importation of .stl and .obj model. My question is how to make the imported vehicle run, just like the vehicles here [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/car](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/car). Thanks a lot.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 15:11:21
Importing meshes isn't enough to model a robot. You should follow the tutorial about robot modeling: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials) (at least until tutorial 7).

##### John520 02/23/2021 15:51:25
Thank you `@Olivier Michel`. I went through the tutorial before. Am I right that I will need to add joints and motors to the wheels for the imported vehicle to run?

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 15:57:30
Hello ! 

I try to use Docker in W10 for running webots without GUI 



I did this command to be able to get Windows files inside my docker : 

`docker run -it -v C:\Users\h.sciascia\Documents\Webots\:/usr/local cyberbotics/webots:latest`



But when my container is opened in command line, there is no webots sources file 



If I do only `docker run -it cyberbotics/webots:latest` , "webots" command is known and i'm able to run webots examples 



Do you had this issue ? 



Thank in advance !

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:14:59
Why do you want to mount the Windows folder to `/usr/local`?



The Webots installation is placed in `/usr/local`, so once you mount the Windows folder you override the Webots installation. Note that the Windows version of Webots cannot run inside of the Linux container.

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:21:58
Oh ok .. 

I just want to run my Webots developped under Windows in a Docker container (to see if the simulation speed up without GUI)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:24:03
Then you have to mount only the Webots project folder (from Windows)

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:24:12
It's ok now with this : 

`docker run -it -v c:/Users/h.sciascia/Documents/Webots:/data cyberbotics/webots:latest ls /data`

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:24:49
Looks better

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:24:51
Thanks, i did not know that webots was at /usr/local

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:25:33
But your simulation will not run faster in Docker because the Docker image uses a virtual display. In the best case, it will run at the same speed.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:25:55
`@Darko Lukić` Is Webots actually running headless in docker, when not using any visual based sensors?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:26:42
No, it never uses truly headless mode.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:26:51
For parallel simulation, this is the main thing holding Webots back compared to Pybullet

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:28:23
We should implement something like this:

[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/egl-eye-opengl-visualization-without-x-server/](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/egl-eye-opengl-visualization-without-x-server/)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:29:37
It would probably be a very tall order, but the Server-Client setup of gazebo and PyBullet makes a lot of sense. Wish Webots would support that

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:29:49
Do you have some analysis of that. I would like to know what was the bottleneck for you, VRAM or RAM?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:30:07
both


If I remember correctly, Vram was always at 800 MB, even when minimized and not rendering anything

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:30:40
How much RAM/VRAM usage, how many instances, and what is the world complexity?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:30:56
it was a very simple world with just a robotic arm


and rectangle arena


was like 5 month ago

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:31:42
So there is no way to run faster the simulation using Windows 10 ? :/

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:31:46
webots also used I think 1.1 GB of ram minimum. However, now on windows, I see it uses below 370MB


I did parallel RL, that quicly saturated my VRAM and RAM


it was cpu only simulation, so it kinda sucked to spend resources on something that is not needed. I can test things again. that was on 2020b


`@h.sciascia` There is many things you can do to speed up the simulation. I have quite some experience with that.


What is your goal, what are you simulating?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:35:35
I have just tested, it is 330MB with `pioneer3at.wbt` (relatively big world + LiDAR)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:35:52
windows or linux?

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:39:05
I cannot explain a lot for confidentiality reason but I use an URDF robot which explore all of its envrionment to detect the collisions (with a personalised physics plugin), go through them and save each collision in a CSV file

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:40:11
So I did simulation for 1-2-3-4 DOF, but with 5 DOF it's becoming really really long (should take 2-3 days to explore all the possibilities)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:40:34
did you profile your code?


IK can take a significant portion of time


I recommend using IKFast, if you are not already


also, increase the step size of your simulation and use simple bounding boxes

##### h.sciascia 02/23/2021 16:41:49
No IK , just iterative imbricated loop for be sure to run trhough all the possibilities


yep i did the increase for step size of the motors and use cubes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:42:29
what is your realtime factor?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:47:48
`@h.sciascia`  As Simon mentioned, you should profile your controller and the physics plugin. The controller is usually cause for the slow simulations.

##### Grassboi 02/23/2021 16:48:34
Hi, just created my robot and I wanted to add a rgbD camera (RFID camera ) But I haven't had any luck finding one. Could you guys help me with that?


RgbD is a depth camera

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:49:11
You should combine the camera node and the range finder node

##### Grassboi 02/23/2021 16:49:41
Oh OK, will have a look into that


Thanks so much

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/23/2021 16:50:39
Just use the same pose for both nodes and the same intrinsic parameters (e.g. FoV)


I discovered a bug:

Can someone please help me resolve this error?



Error: ignoring illegal call to wb\_differential\_wheels\_set\_speed() in a 'Robot' controller.

Error: this function can only be used in a 'DifferentialWheels' controller.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 18:21:30
`@Srivastav_Udit`  The differential wheels node has been deprecated so you shouldn't be using it unless you really need to. You can achieve the same with a classic Robot node setting a hinge to either side and setting the left and right motor accordingly

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 18:33:27
Thank you so much Daniel! I'm trying to use the wb\_differential\_wheels\_get\_left\_encoder(); function with the epuck. Can you recommend another way to achieve this function on the epuck?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 18:36:40
You can add also PositionSensors to the hinges, same way you add the motors

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 18:37:33
I'll try that, thanks again!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 02/23/2021 18:40:38
there's an epuck sample world already to see how it's done: file > open sample world > robot > gctronic > epuck

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:24:26
Has anyone worked on a simple object transportation algorithm using a camera with obstacle avoidance?


I'm essentially trying to search for an object and transport it to a "nest" in the fastest way possible avoiding any obstacles

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:26:19
what do you mean by "transport" ?


Are we talking abstract 3d movement, or a roboter manipulating it?

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:27:46
I've created a robot that is supposed to detect a ball in an arena and transport it to a nest

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:28:01

oh, is this your actual physical setup?

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:30:49
Yes, the robot has a gripper that can hold the ball

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:31:02
are you using ROS?


to control the bot

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:31:46
No, I'm not very familiar with ROS yet

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:32:19
are you using an overhead camera? or onboard?


and how do you control the bot?

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:34:16
I have a camera attached to the bot. It essentially spins till it detects the ball and then attempts to move towards it and grips the ball if it is within the reach  of the gripper.


I'm trying to work out how it can find the best path to the nest avoiding obstacles. I also need to understand how I can release the ball in the nest and then go search the arena again.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:35:45
sorry, I dont have experience with this


you might want to look into "SLAM", but that is more advanced


but I think you need to implement odometry of some sort, so the robot knows where it is


simplest solution would probably trying to drive directly towards the nest and to just drive around obstacles

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:37:48
mobile robot navigation is a relatively well researched topic with a lot of algorithms already implemented well. I think it is easier to learn ROS and use the navigation stack of ros than to reimplement these algorithms


the navigation stack may be overkill though if you want to find a "hacky" solution


but if you have lots of obstacles in the environment something like slam is definitely required


otherwise you could get away with some simple object detection and maybe potential field navigation


but if you want to get into robotics, it's really useful to know ROS

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:39:35
Do you have any algorithm/sample project I could use for reference?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:39:53
no, sorry

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:40:49
Can you give me a reference point to get started with ROS? I don't have a lot of obstacles in my environment but I do have to attempt a swarm implementation later on.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:43:20
ROS takes a while to wrap your head around

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:43:43
the ROS wiki is your friend [https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/). In my opinion it is better to start using ROS2 right away since ROS 1 is nearing end of life (2025)


yes `@Simon Steinmann`  is right, it takes quite a bit of time to get to know it


there is also the ROS2 controller for webots [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:45:06
[https://www.theconstructsim.com/](https://www.theconstructsim.com/) I did this online academy. Yes it cost a bit of money, but I learned in 2 weeks much more than I did in the 2-3 moth before, trying to figure it out myself

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:45:52
it is a bit difficult to estimate for your use case if it is better to learn ROS, which will benefit you a lot in the future if you continue doing robotics, or to implement your own solution

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:47:08
This might be a silly question but if I were to write a controller without ROS and had multiple robots to collect and drop these balls in a nest (probably like the hacky solution you mentioned) - what would you recommend ?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:48:17
if you want to stay inside webots there is the emitter and receiver: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter), [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver)

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:49:50
Would this involve a supervisor since there are multiple robots?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/23/2021 20:52:24
no, you dont need a supervisor controller to do that

##### Srivastav\_Udit 02/23/2021 20:54:50
Okay, thanks!

##### SeanLuTW 02/24/2021 02:55:44
I think I found the problem. After reload world or reset the simulator, the `hidden` descriptions in the world file were eliminated, which caused the angle offset. (`hidden` tells link how many angle to rotate, and `position` tells the position sensor current angle)


How can I avoid eliminating the `hidden` descriptions after reset the controller?

##### h.sciascia 02/24/2021 08:13:53
Hello ! Didn't see this message my bad



What do you mean by realtime factor ? Are you talking about the speed of the simulation ? Or the timeStep in my application ?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 08:56:14
did you properly save your world?

##### SeanLuTW 02/24/2021 08:58:45
Yes, I saved my world, and I can see the `hidden` in the file. But after I clicked reset simulator, the robot just went back to original pose.


I read the document from [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto-hidden-fields](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto-hidden-fields) . Maybe after clicking reset button, the `hidden` description just been ignored by the simulator?


If I used reload world, everything seems alright. But the world is pretty completed, it spend lots of time to load

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 09:18:03
to clarify this a bit more, you changed the value of the position field in the JointParameter node?

##### SeanLuTW 02/24/2021 09:20:11
Yes, I defined a `SFFloat` variable to specify the initial angle in PROTO, and use this variable to set the `position` under `HingeJointParameters`

##### Vangiel 02/24/2021 09:21:10
hello everyone. I have two simple questions that I don't get to solve. Using python: How can I get the basictimestep of the simulation? How can I get the simulation time? Thanks

##### SeanLuTW 02/24/2021 09:26:40
`getBasicTimeStep` and `getTime`in  `Robot`  Here is the document [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=python#wb\_robot\_get\_time](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=python#wb_robot_get_time)

##### Vangiel 02/24/2021 09:27:02
Thanks a lot

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 09:44:13
I think the problem with changing the position field is described in the field description of the JointParameters Node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters#field-summary)


`The position field represents the current position of the joint, in radians or meters. For an hinge or ball, it is the current rotation angle in radians. For a slider, it is the magnitude of the current translation in meters. When changing the position field from the Webots scene tree, Webots also changes the corresponding rotation (for a hinge or ball) or translation (for a slider) field in the endPoint solid of the parent joint node to keep the consistency of the model. Similarly, when changing the position field of a JointParameters node in a text editor, you should take care of also changing the corresponding rotation or translation field accordingly.`


so you only change the position of the joint but not the transformation to the endPoint


this kind of makes it hard to set different initial positions of a single proto model


and for each joint you need to calculate original\_rotation\_matrix x rotation\_introduced\_by\_joint (if these are rotation matrices)

##### SeanLuTW 02/24/2021 09:57:44
Maybe the best solution is to change the PROTO into base node 😦

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:26:10
Hey guys, I have two working cameras on my robot but they both seem blurry and out of focus, how do I fix this?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:27:31
could you share the definition of the camera node in your proto?

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:28:40
Sorry what do you mean by that?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:30:15
In the proto file, the file that defines your robot, there should be a camera definition that looks somewhat like this:

```Camera {
  fieldOfView 0.5
  ....
}
```

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:33:24
Oh the lines I've used in my code?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:33:59
not your controller code


what robot are you using, did you define it yourself, or did you use a preconfigured one?

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:34:56
Its one I'm making myself for a coursework, sorry I'm new to this only been doing it for about 2 weeks

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:36:37
dont worry 😄

you should have created a `robot.proto`file, to define the robot. can you share that?

 if you dont want it publicly, you can also pm me

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:39:42
realtime factor is the speed your simulation runs at. If you had an absolutely perfect 1x realtime factor, the simulation time and real time would progress at the same rate. From what you describe, you should be able to get realtime factors in the area of 10x-200x. Of course this also heavily depends on your system, in particualr the single core speed of your CPU. What are your system specs?

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:41:08
I don't think I have a proto file, the protos folder is empty. Don't worry they aren't too bad, should be good enough for my robot to work, thank you for the help anyway

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:41:30
`@Callum98` how did you add the cameras?


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python)


perhaps you specified a focus value


look at your robot node in the scene tree on the left. What settings do you have there?

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:42:37
In robot children clicked the add button and specified camera, creating a shape as something to see

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:43:05
the default resolution is 64x64

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:43:55
How do I change the resolution so I can show camera image bigger? without it losing focus

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:44:37
expand the camera node


you should see all the settings there


use the documentation link I sent, to adjust the settings

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 11:46:03
There is a difference between an image being really low resolution and being out of focus

##### Callum98 02/24/2021 11:49:57
Like this, I just want the image to be a bit clearer

Very old specs : 4GB Ram, Intel Core i5 4310U (2-2.6 GHz) , no graphic card

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/24/2021 12:39:34
that is already really good. I dont think you'll get much faster than that. But for your task you might want to look into different solutions, as you dont require physics

##### h.sciascia 02/24/2021 12:40:37
Yes I will try ROS , maybe it's better for my app

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/24/2021 12:41:01

Hi `@Olivier Michel`, I'd like to follow up on the question I asked yesterday. In order to run the imported vehicle, I will need to add joints and motors to the wheels. In the tutorial [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=c++](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=c++), a controller is used to control the motors. My question is, could I use ROS to control the motors? Thank you!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/24/2021 15:20:48
Yes, of course. There are many online tutorials explaining how to use ROS and ROS 2 with Webots.

##### John520 02/24/2021 15:30:08
`@Olivier Michel` Thanks a lot. I guess I would need to follow this [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor?tab-language=ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor?tab-language=ros) to control the motors. I used ROS to control the truck you provides in Webots successfully before.

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/24/2021 16:40:33
you need to set the DEF of the TeslaModel3 to be able to access it, click on the tesla in the scene tree and below there should be a text field


set that to TeslaModel3


or you can use wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_self

##### yanan 02/24/2021 16:44:41
thanks a lot. it works. I forget to put TeslaModel3 as the DEF although the in scene tree it displays 'TeslaModel3', which is a little bit confusing

Hello everyone, I am migrating the simulation of my robot project to Webots and, to be as close to reality as possible, I would like to use a controller based on ros topics, not services like the premade controller on Webots\_ros package. I tried use the Custom Ros Controller tutorials on the webots website itself, but I didn't get any results in compiling webots and ros together. Do you suggest any tutorial or material bigger or more complete than the site?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/25/2021 07:51:07

If possible, I would highly recommend you to go with ROS 2, as our ROS 2 bridge creates a ROS 2 interface that is much closer to one on the real robots + the behavior is highly customizable:

If you use `getFromDef` then you have to match DEF of the ConveyorBelt

##### Chernayaten 02/25/2021 14:45:06
You probably need to do getSFFloat  to get the speed, and you should also be doing that inside the while, otherwise the value will not update

does anyone know how to set the point of rotation for a shape?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/25/2021 15:28:55
what do you mean by point of rotation?

##### Le Fromage 02/25/2021 15:31:37
im pretty new, im basically trying to make 4 legs for an animal of some sort


so the rotational motor would need to be at the top of the leg

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 02/25/2021 15:34:01
a motor is always inside of hingejoint. And a hingejoint connects two Solids


Solid > children > hingejoint > endPoint Solid


the solids have translation and rotation fields, where you can position them


to make things easier, make sure that the translation of the endpoint solid is the same as the anchor of the hingejoint

do you initialize (blue = 0) the variable blue somewhere before these lines?

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/25/2021 16:14:03
If I have multiple simulations running at the same time, I can use the environment variable WEBOTS\_PID to tell an external controller to which simulation it should connect. I am running a python external controller. Does someone by chance know if the state of this environment variable is relevant at the time of import or at the time of instantiation of the Robot object?

##### alejanpa17 02/25/2021 16:24:45

And other question, is it possible to limit the render distance in order to optimize the simulation performance?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/25/2021 16:27:10
You can start a Webots instance and external controller pair with the same `WEBOTS_TMPDIR`:

Thank you, I will give it a try

##### yanan 02/26/2021 09:33:09
Hello, I am using two controllers, one for Mavic2Pro with an emitter, the other for TeslaModel3 with a receiver.  The Tesla is receiving the position information from the drone. However, it seems like the receiver can not real-timely get the latest info from the emitter, it can only get a pack one by one hence resulting in a delay to get the latest info from the emitter.

yeah, that's true.  and that 1 is not latest


is there any synchronization mechanism between two controllers using emitter and receiver?  or do I have to use same amount of sending packs and receiving packs?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/26/2021 09:43:50
That is strange. Can you send us a minimal example?


>  or do I have to use same amount of sending packs and receiving packs?

But you are receiving the packets in the loop which means that you should receive all the packets you have sent.

it might also because the emitting frequency is different from receiver's.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/26/2021 09:51:39

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/26/2021 10:13:10
Inside of `while (wb_receiver_get_queue_length(receiver) > 0)` you are essentially doing:

```
int step = 3;
double rot_step = M_PI/4;
for(int i = -step; i <= step; i++ )
{
  for(int j = -step; j <= step; j++)
  {
     for(float r = 0; r <= M_PI; r +=rot_step)
     {
          wb_robot_step(64);
     }
  }         
}
```


You have a lag of like 300 steps per single drone step

##### jasper [Moderator] 02/26/2021 13:35:35
Thanks for your response, I have not used `WEBOTS_TMPDIR` but again the PID and I figured out the response to my question through some testing. The environment variable `WEBOTS_PID` is read at the time when the robot controller is created (in python that is when you do `r = Robot()`) and not at import time. The same also holds for `WEBOTS_ROBOT_NAME`.

The original confusion came from rospy checking the parameter `ROS_NAMESPACE`at the time when it is imported and not at the time when a node is initialized.

what units do the pioneer 3dx distance sensors use?

They use the following lookup table:

```
lookupTable [
  0 1024 0.01,
  5 0 0.01
]
```

See more about lookup tables here:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)

##### Icy\_Flurry 02/26/2021 15:33:39
thanks, ill look at that!


i dont quite understand how i would use that to convert the readings into mm/cm/m

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 02/26/2021 17:20:54
The lookup table emulates the raw readings from the sensor


To get the actual distance from the particular lookup table you should do something like this:

```
distance_in_meters = 5 - (5 * value_from_sensor) / 1024
```

##### tbt24 02/27/2021 11:35:30
The light sensor will just return the intensity of light. Then, when a colour filter is applied, ideally the light intensity will be multiplied by some value between 0 and 1 for RGB depending on the colour. However, the light sensor currently does not detect an 'LED' spotlight in my world

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 02/27/2021 12:34:55

It is not enough to change the file, but you need to recompile Webots (clone the GitHub repo, modify the source file and compile Webots).

Otherwise you can download the latest nightly build of R2021a-rev1 that already contains the fix:

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/01/2021 15:05:00
From the video, it seems that the `JointParameter.anchor` may not be correctly aligned with the center of the wheel.

Usually, this value should correspond to the "endPoint" `Solid.translation`.

The joint axes can be visualized in the 3D scene by enabling the "Optional Rendering" > "Show Joint Axes" option  in the "View" menu. It may also be needed to increase the `WorldInfo.lineScale` value (for example to 2).

`robot.getDevice(lidar_sensor_name)`

##### Vangiel 03/01/2021 18:33:04
yes, I tried that, but because it is a proto it says that class Node doesn't have getDevice method. It seems that it doesn't recognise as a Robot node

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 18:33:51
you need to do something like `robot = Robot()` in the beginning


if you are using a supervisor like `s = Supervisor()` then you need to call the function `getDevice`on the supervisor

##### Vangiel 03/01/2021 18:36:53
The thing is that I am using a robot supervisor node (without shape or anything) to control the whole simulation. So I get the robot node with the lidar sensor from the supervisor. For making it work I should call the getDevice in the controller of the robot with the lidar? Can't I do it from the supervisor robot?

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 18:38:26

And what I want is to get the lidar sensor from the one with supervisor privileges if possible

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 18:39:48
can you post the code of the robot controller, private message is also ok if you dont want to share it publicly

##### Vangiel 03/01/2021 18:40:08
sure, give me a moment

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 18:41:28
ah, ok, thats something different than I expected, I have an idea on how this could work but I need to test it, give me a moment.

##### Vangiel 03/01/2021 18:43:10
ok perfect, if you still need the code I can send it to you.

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 18:49:36
I tested how I think it could have worked, but unfortunately it did not. I think devices are only accessible from the robots own controller and I am not aware that there is any method to do otherwise.


do you need to have the actual sensor data in the supervisor controller or can you do the required calculations in the robot controller and pass them to the supervisor controller using either a emitter receiver combo or the `customData` field?

##### Vangiel 03/01/2021 18:52:38
Ok thanks for the help. I can try to do the calculations in the robot controller. I know about the emitter receiver but what is the customData field?

##### Saud 03/01/2021 19:03:05
ok thanks let me have a look at that


i am not the greatest at webots so do excuse my wrongness if it is but i added the lidar and I am trying to use it in code. C++. I enabled the other devices using this but this one does not work. I am gonna guess because the others were already in mavic. But i have added the lidar to the bodySlot. Did it do this in a wrong way?

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 19:28:06
for getting devices from the robot, you usually use the methods described here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb\_robot\_get\_device](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb_robot_get_device)


so you would have something like:

```Lidar *l;
l = robot->getLidar(lidar\_name)
```


or try:

`Lidar *l = new Lidar(lidar_name`


but i dont know if the second one works

##### Saud 03/01/2021 19:30:38

can you provide me your insight on this?

i am still new to webots and opencv

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 19:55:45
you want to use camera.getImage() instead of that

##### Welsh\_dragon64 03/01/2021 19:56:02
is that reserved variable?

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 20:01:45
you create your camera in line 40 and enable it in line 41, then you need to use the camera object in your while loop to get the image using `img = camera.getImage()`


the webots image is `BGRA`encoded though


I don't know what you mean by reserved variable.

##### Welsh\_dragon64 03/01/2021 20:09:29
I dont understand where to  place img = camera.getImage() in the while loop.

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 20:10:09

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 20:13:15
too many values to unpack means that you expect more return values than there are, you say you want 2 values, success and img but camera.getImage() only returns one value

##### Welsh\_dragon64 03/01/2021 20:15:51
I removed the success so it can return one value and now i got this new error.

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/01/2021 20:17:24
you need to somehow transform the array of pixel data into a opencv image but I dont know how to do that


but you can check the documentation of the webots to see what its format is [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb\_camera\_get\_image](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb_camera_get_image)


scroll a bit down to the python note from the link

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/02/2021 11:25:45
`@Welsh_dragon64` 

`def getFrame():

    data = camera.getImage()

    frame = numpy.frombuffer(data, numpy.uint8).reshape((camera.getHeight(), camera.getWidth(), 4))

    return frame`



Try this code


this should be a valid cv2 frame / image

Make sure you are running the simulation and that your robot has a controller (it can be `void`).

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 15:32:22
Hey guys, I've got my robot with a camera that recognises the colour red but I want it to send a message, for example 'Red object ahead', when it comes into its vision. Is this possible?

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 15:46:01
You can use an emitter and a receiver 

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver)

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 16:03:37
Im looking at the sample camera robot and that does it with a camera but Im using java so having difficulty transferring it across

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 16:08:35
In the camera.wbt? That robot is not sending a message somewhere, it is simply printing it

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 16:09:37
Oh ok, I still don't see an emitter or receiver on the robot

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 16:11:21
The robot is not sending a message that can be received by someone else. It is simply printing it. What exactly are you having an issue with?

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 16:13:05
Yeah that's what I want. I will send a picture one sec but I want my robot to print out 'Red object detected' as there is a red object being outlined by the camera

So since the robot detects that red object I want it to print out saying its found it

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 16:15:09
> if (redObjectDetected): print("Red object ahead") 

If you want to print it why don't you print it then?

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 16:15:56
Is that the only line of code needed? Sorry I dont really know how to code thats the problem 😦

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 16:17:27
My guess is that you're asking the wrong thing and you want to know how to detected the red object, not how to print a message saying you did

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 16:19:02
Its already detected that's why there's a box around it

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 16:19:27
The lines of code that do this in camera.wbt are 120-139.

Hi guys, I am working on a HingeJoint but am having an issue that some parameter values change by themselves when the simulation starts.


Please take a look at the below two figures. The translation and rotation of the endPoint Solid change after the simulation starts. So the robot cannot go straight because of this. The first figure shows the original setting, while the second one shows the values after the simulation starts.

Pk Ill have a look thank you man

##### Chernayaten 03/02/2021 16:22:00
If the object is already detected (make sure it detects the color as well and not just the object), then you can use a boolean variable to print your message

##### Callum98 03/02/2021 16:22:34
Ok sure thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/02/2021 16:37:06
Take a look at this:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/hingejoint?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/hingejoint?tab-language=python)


The axis and anchor is relative to the parent, so the translation and rotation of the endpoint Solid will change of course


Or at least, only rotating around the hingejoint axis

##### John520 03/02/2021 16:40:58
`@Simon Steinmann` Thanks a lot for your explanation. Is it possible to make the translation of the endPoint Solid not change?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/02/2021 16:41:50
it can be much easier to translate the parent to where you want it, and only translating the anchor and endPoint along the joint axis


in your case, only in x - direction

##### John520 03/02/2021 16:42:15
SInce other wheels have the same changes, the vehicle is not able to go straight.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/02/2021 16:44:30
You can add Transforms or Solid nodes as a parent of the hingejoint


position them  xyz, where they should be (would be your current anchor and translation). Then you set the anchor to 0 0 0, and the translation to 0 0 0

##### John520 03/02/2021 16:48:49
`@Simon Steinmann` I see, I am trying it. Thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate it.

##### Elizaveta\_Potemkina 03/02/2021 16:53:30
Hi guys,

I'm trying to select and place sensors on a robot that's meant to search for small blocks in an arena and go pick them up. Currently thinking of using ultrasonics to look for possible/clustered blocks, and then infrared readings while turning towards what it thinks is a block to actually get a bearing, because IR sensors seem to have a very small viewing angle at mid-range

My problem is, I don't understand why IR sensors are modelled to give an average distance reading with a gaussian weighting of the rays in Webots. Is that actually realistic to how an IR would work? I've looked at datasheets and I can't tell. I'm worried it would mess up the readings if blocks/a block and a wall are close in bearing but at different distances to the robot. Would it be reasonable to ignore the IR sensor presets on Webots and just model it to return the nearest distance with a small viewing angle?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/02/2021 17:36:33
No, IR sensors models in Webots are as realistic as possible. Because they reflect IR light, the return value depends on the amount of reflected light. If only one small area (represented by a few rays) reflects light, the measured value will be small, which is what you can observe in real IR sensors.


If you need the nearest value, you should set the type to "laser" or "sonar".

##### Elizaveta\_Potemkina 03/02/2021 17:39:05
I see. I've found a proto in the default Webots files for the exact IR I'd have access to IRL for this project. (Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F). It's made by the manufacturer, and I can see that it's modeled as having only 1 ray. Should I just chalk that up to the manufacturer being optimistic about their own product?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/02/2021 17:40:48
Having only one ray is probably a performance / accuracy compromise.


If you need more accuracy, you should add more rays, but keep the aperture small enough to match the datasheet of the real sensor.

i cant seem to find the file at the location provided by the link above.



It say its located at WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/web/visual\_tracking  where the sample simulation uses opencv and numpy packages using python,but i cant find it anywhere. Can someone help me with this.

##### Elizaveta\_Potemkina 03/02/2021 17:43:38
That's one of the irritating things, they don't list an angle range on the datasheet at all. Best I've found is buried in a technical details file for a bunch of similar products giving something like a 5 degree viewing angle at the mid-high end of its range. I guess that's something to consider programming in

##### Pancha 03/02/2021 21:09:17
I have a general question with regards to Webots. We have a rather complex series of links that would be too difficult/time consuming to simulate. These links would extend out from a movable object in a straight line (essentially floating in air due to internal structures/tension). These links can extend and retract. My question then is;

  - Is it possible to make shapes that has ``boundingObject`` set but not ``physics`` (set to NULL)? This allows for the object to interact with others (collide) but still floats in the air. The moment I set ``physics`` to ``Physics`` it falls to the ground, but without ``physics`` set it does not collide.

  - Is it possible to make some shapes/solids collide (links colliding with wall for instance) whereas some solid/shapes does not (links not colliding with eachother / allows for them to be located inside each other)?

I really do hope there's a solution here 🙂

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/02/2021 21:11:20
you can disable gravity in webots using a supervisor controller if that does not interfere with the rest of your simulation

##### Pancha 03/02/2021 21:13:46
Hmm, that would interfere with the rest of the simulation as it depends on gravity. I guess I can do it the "easy way" and just refrain from using bounding objects on them and instead have some fictive distance sensors on the links emulating a "hit" on walls for instance 🙂

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/02/2021 21:18:06

Hey, I am using a display attached to my robot's camera to draw rectangles around objects detected by a object detector. Can I somehow delete the rectangles ,drawn on one frame , the next frame? Draw rectangle seems permanent on the display module.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/03/2021 08:58:30
Yes you can delete them by redrawing a transparent rectangle over the previously drawn objects.

Here is a sample code from the built-in Webots projects/samples/devices/worlds/display.wbt simulation:

##### Tosidis 03/03/2021 10:16:57
I will try to report it later when I finish this. It happens due to resizing (display box inside world window is smaller than actual size and some lines won't render correctly. If I resize the window to the original size it shows the rectangles correctly)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/03/2021 10:19:32
Ok, thank you. Good to know that the Display functions are working correctly and it is just a resizing issue. By the way I'm not sure it could be fixed: when making an image smaller it is normal that some pixel information is missing.

Hello everyone ! how to find the optimal thread count for the worldInfo settings ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/03/2021 12:47:22
The optimal thread count strictly depends on the simulation. So the only way to find the best value is by manually changing the value and check the simulation speed.

But note that only the physics engine is using multi-threading, so you will only get some benefits by setting the thread count > 1 if you have multiple robots or dynamic objects that doesn't interact or if you have distinct groups of interacting objects. In the latter case, a good threads count could be the number of distinct groups of robots/objects.

stable-baselines3 is based on pytorch. You might save yourself A LOT of work using that

How much time does your algorithm take to calculate an action from the given state?

##### h.sciascia 03/03/2021 13:38:06
my problem is mainly the huge time of simulation needed to train the agent


i didn't mesure it. it's a 2 hidden layers neural network (actor: 600x400)  so not much


the function that takes a lot of a time is the learning function


that updates the neural networks


along side another function that check for collision with obstacles present in the environment

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/03/2021 13:40:02
maybe have a look at this paper: [https://www.groundai.com/project/towards-simplicity-in-deep-reinforcement-learning-streamlined-off-policy-learning/2](https://www.groundai.com/project/towards-simplicity-in-deep-reinforcement-learning-streamlined-off-policy-learning/2)

A quick question, is it possible to load a solid exported as .wbo into a solid node?


Forgot do specify: In a proto file. I know I can import in the GUI, but was wondering if it was possible in a proto file

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/04/2021 07:20:16
There is no built-in function for this.  But you have different options:

1) turn the WBO node into a PROTO node so that it can easily be used in other PROTO files and nodes

2) import the WBO object from the Supervisor controller at the very beginning of the simulation

3) read and import the WBO file directly in the procedural PROTO file using Lua statements (a WBO object can be inserted as-is without any modifications to the file content other than removing the header line).

##### Master.L 03/04/2021 08:38:22
Hello! I have a question.

I am trying to create a simulation using webots and ros.

I am trying to control the joints by placing a motor on each joint of the webots robot by calling a service from ros.

In addition, I am trying to give values to a total of 3 joints by calling rosservice, but at the same time, a delay occurs because values are entered sequentially instead of entering each joint.

How can I send values at the same time?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/04/2021 08:41:36
If the `synchronization` field of your robot is set to `TRUE` then all service calls should be performed in the single timestep:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot)


In addition, you should use the `--synchronize` argument:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros)

to ensure that all the service calls are performed in the single timestep

##### Master.L 03/04/2021 09:19:58
`@Darko Lukić` Is there any example that I can refer to?


I currently use the controller as ros and create a ros package and run it externally.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/04/2021 09:25:23
Unfortunately, there is no example. You should configure the robot as in picture

![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/816964535080321064/unknown.png)
%end


And you should get the `time_step` service exposed that you have to call at each step

##### Master.L 03/04/2021 09:48:00
`@Darko Lukić` Should I call time\_step before calling set\_position to each joint?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/04/2021 09:49:03
After. The `time_step` service calls the `wb_robot_step` function:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_step](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_step)

##### Master.L 03/04/2021 10:00:14
Thank you `@Darko Lukić` . I will try it and ask you again if there is a problem.

?


Thanks

##### kRiSh 03/06/2021 12:48:18
It would happen due to external factors like friction and slipping.


To eliminate this maybe instill a PID control where you utilize the Gyro readings to make it go in a straight line.

Hi, I'm having alot of issues with solids going through eachother. Happens with robots and solids made in webots and with imported solids and I don't really know why. I've tried some of the suggestions on here [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling) but nothing seems to work. Thanks

##### jasper [Moderator] 03/06/2021 18:15:48
is the problem that the center of the fbx file is not where you want it or is it imported incorrectly into webots? To test you could try to export it in a different format, .obj for example, and reload. You can add a Transform node around the import of the model to change translation or orientation (in axis angle convention).


do you have bounding objects for your solids? If not, add some. Otherwise, if the solids are part of the same robot you might need to enable self collision in the robot node

##### benj3110 03/06/2021 18:20:37
yea they are all bounded with physics and they are different solids.

##### Vial 03/08/2021 18:05:28
Hi Webots community,

We are working on an automous robot competition where robots can't be connected to external PC

and usually runs on STM32 or dspic microcontrolers.

For debug purposes, we would like to display real sensor data/ point cloud/ pathfinding stuff from 

a C/C++ node connected to our robot to the Webots environement.

I think usually the robot community uses ROS/rviz to do so, but for differents internal reasons, we would like

to not use ROS and there must be a way to do everything from Webots anyway.

So I dive in the Supervisor programming and try to display everything we need but I really feel like I'm doing it wrong.

Is there a proper way to display real time point cloud/ path in webots ?



So far I'm working with a Shape/ geometry / PointSet and I feel like I can do something from this but it's quiet messy, 

it always feels like I have to find workarounds. 

I need to create a Node somewhere in the tree to store point cloud, clean the previous points in the coord/color fields if

some points already exist but I can't get the exact amount of points in

the pointSet from supervisor so I have to delete/recreate the node (there is no endpoints to get the the number of points you have in a field).

At the moment I still have a few bugs/undersirable behavior but it seems that I can at least generate a point cloud (All the points are white though, I need to reload the whole world to see the 

corect color).

Am I doing it right and it's just a matter of experience/knowledge with the supervisor API or is it beyond webots scope at the moment ?

Just to be clear, I'm not just criticize the API, I'm really enthousiastic about this project. I'm just trying to improve the development sharing my user experience.

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar?tab-language=c++](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar?tab-language=c++) this might help too


oh, but the data is not from inside the simulation right, it's from the actual robot


ROS and Rviz really are simple solution for this. lightweight too, as it only displays and not simulates anything


`@Vial` I think you are overthinking your solution


this is my scene tree
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/818554789364760646/unknown.png)
%end


if you want to have the same color for all the points, just add a normal appearance node to the shape, and define the emissive color


Then you just set the Shape > pointSet > Coordinate to your pointcloud


you can give the Coordinate node a DEF "PointCloudCoord" in my screenshot

![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/818555492405608468/unknown.png)
%end


then you can use the supervisor "getFromDef" functionality


i might be easier to import the whole thing as a string

![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/818558629325701180/unknown.png)
%end


instead of line 36, you could generate a string form your pointcloud, with the structure of my screenshot


every point being separated by a comma


this might be faster, as only one call will be made to Webots, instead of one call per point


I'm not good with c++, so I dont know how to construct that string


`@Darko Lukić` is there a way to "setMF" a whole MF, without having to do it index  by index?


Something like 

`point.setMFVec3f( [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]] )`


or is that what 

`insertMFVec3f()` does?


or can it be only done via the importMFNodeFromString() function

##### Vial 03/08/2021 19:55:15
Hi `@Simon Steinmann` , 

Thanks a lot for your insights.

I should definitely try the string or file approach.

I just figured out that only some type of nodes can be exported to .wbo files.

I can try to save a template of the whole "shape pointCloud" as a .wbo file, and delete it/load it first and then update it as I can keep track on what I'm doing with this new node.

I'll try tomorow, thanks a lot for your time 🙂

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/09/2021 07:11:46
You approach seems globally correct. If you need to reload the world to see the correct color, it might be a bug in Webots. Please test it with the latest Webots R2021a-rev1 nightly build where the bug might be already fixed. If not fixed, please open a bug report on GitHub with a simple source code example and we will look into it.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/09/2021 07:32:44
As far as I know you have to combine `wb_supervisor_field_set_mf_vec3f`, `wb_supervisor_field_insert_mf_vec3f`, and `wb_supervisor_field_remove_mf`.

Yes I have essentially what I am trying to do is get lidar values to calculate the volume of the boxes

ok i have managed to get values now but when i get the number of layers of the lidar it only returns 1 which means there are only 2 layers? quite confused why this is. i guess it explains the two lines. Currently i am using Hokuyo UTM-30LX. What i want is the drone to make a scan of the ground like a scanner would. Is this the correct lidar for that?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/09/2021 19:46:50

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/10/2021 14:54:19
You should change the `JointParameters.anchor` value so that it matches the initial `endPoint Solid` translation.


You can also enable the visualization of the joint axes from the `View > Optional Rendering > Show Joint Axes` to make that it is correctly set.

##### AndyPandyO 03/10/2021 15:01:17
I did that, as you can see here. but it still resets the endPoint soldid translation

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/10/2021 15:02:56
At position 0, both the endPoint translation and joint anchor should have the same value.

If the endPoint position is reset, then you can copy and paste the anchor value in the translation field.

##### AndyPandyO 03/10/2021 15:06:21
I did exactly that, same result. Thanks for the speedy response

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/10/2021 15:12:08
Did you try to save and revert the simulation after fixing the `anchor` value?

##### bellino 03/10/2021 16:01:22
Hello, I have a question about the charger and battery. I have a robot whose battery field is set to [51840, 51840, 2.4] and a charger whose battery field is set to the same values. When I move the robot to the charger the first field in the charger immediately goes to zero. I had a look at the example battery.wbt but besides the recharge speed and cpuConsumption (I am using the default value), I could not spot a difference. Any guess as to what I could be doing wrong?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/10/2021 16:24:05
Note that also in the example `battery.wbt` the first value of the `Charger.battery` field immediately goes to 0, but given that the recharge speed is higher, the robot gets recharged.


I'm reviewing the charging code to check if this is really the wanted behavior.

##### bellino 03/10/2021 16:56:18
higher then what? Do you mean the recharge time of the robot? I tried setting the recharge time of the robot to 4.8 but it didn't work, is this what you mean?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/10/2021 17:15:44
Yes. But you should try at least with 30 or similar (in the `battery.wbt` example).


By the way, the Charger behavior seems wrong and should be fixed ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2843](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2843))

##### bellino 03/10/2021 17:39:41
thank you very much, it sort of works now with a higher recharge value!

Hi, I’m trying to get my robot to go forward and avoids walls but stop and pick up a small object. I am struggling to get it to do both. If I have a small object it stops like it’s supposed to but for the wall it starts to turn then it stops. I’m sure it’s something so small but hoping I could get suggestions on how to allow the robot to do what it to do. I have uploaded 2 photos of my code to see if there are any mistakes. I am using C++. Thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2021 20:19:26
your code is a bit confusing. What is the exact behavior you want?


what is `obstacle_p` supposed to mean?


`avoidObstacleCounter` you decrease by 1 every step, but obstacle\_p gets set to 100, but never lowered back down

##### EmzG 03/10/2021 20:23:21
obstacle\_p is supposed to be another counter for the object sensor. this sensor is the one that will stop at small object.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2021 20:23:35
you are using the same name for object and distance sensor


"ds"


try this
> **Attachment**: [obstacle.cpp](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/819305034164469790/obstacle.cpp)


changed ds to os for object sensors


also changed the indentation a bit. was hard to read

##### EmzG 03/10/2021 20:27:49
right is that what's the problem. cause i initially started with two file one which just had the two left and right sensors then the other file had the object sensor and both work fine independently. but combine them and wont work, i will give it a try. thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2021 20:28:37
also, the way you have set it up, it will never move again, once it detected an object and stops

##### EmzG 03/10/2021 20:34:57
these errors seem to come up. that os is not declared

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/10/2021 20:35:23
yeah, you have to adjust your initialization


not sure why you do it in a loop anyways, when it is a single sensor


DistanceSensor *os;


or something


you can remove the loop


try this. I'm not very good with c++, but this might work

The GPS sensor returns position in the global coordinate system. The coordinate system of your robot is not relevant. Can you provide more details about the issue?

Our code is written in C++ and it is crashing at different times every time we run it. It is a simple one robot controller for a uni project and we aren't entirely sure if it has anything to do with running on laptops that don't use the supported graphics cards (worth noting that if I close as many things as possible in Task Manager, the time of crash increases)? Would an indexing problem cause this sort of issue in multi-threading? And if so, how do I localise the issue if I can't use print statements?

Thank you `@Darko Lukić` 

I would like to know the position of the end-effector relative to the robot base through the sensor in the simulation. How can I do it?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/11/2021 17:53:05
Typical way of calculating end-point pose (in the real-world) is by putting an encoder in each joint of the arm. Then, you just calculate a forward kinematics given the encoder values and the robot model. You can do the same thing in the simulation.


If you are allowed to "cheat" then you can use:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation)

(see the `Python Example: ` subsection)


There is a Webots example using `ikpy`:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/irb4600-40#inverse\_kinematics-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/irb4600-40#inverse_kinematics-wbt)

You can change it to calculate the forward kinematics:

Hi Webots experts!


I met with a Webots problem recently. Could you please help me with it? Thank you so much!



My Webots can not work with my old files - which works well before. Recently I face up a problem that I use Webots 2019b and 2021a, which are different from what I used before. 



When I build the controller, the error shows "Makefile:74: D:/Users/Liu/AppData/Local/Programs/Webots /resources/Makefile.include: No such file or directory

make: *** No rule to make target 'D:/Users/Liu/AppData/Local/Programs/Webots /resources/Makefile.include'.  Stop." 



 

Then I did the following tries.



1. I checked my computer did include 'D:/Users/Liu/AppData/Local/Programs/Webots /resources/Makefile.include'



2. Then I delete my old "Makefile"  in the related controller file, and compile the controller in Webots, the Webots creates a new  "Makefile"  in the related controller file. The error above is solved but "WARNING: SL\_AGD\_Ini\_Star: The process crashed sometime after starting successfully.

WARNING: 'SL\_AGD\_Ini\_Star' controller crashed."



Thank you very much!

Hi, I am trying to calculate the degree difference between my nao robot and a target point. My ultimate goal is to turn my robot in that direction and to move towards that direction. 

            angle = round(math.atan2(-(relativeX), relativeZ), 4)



            degrees = round(angle * (180 / math.pi), 4)    

This is how I calculate the degree between the robot and the target point. I subtract this from the robots angle and I rotate the robot according to result. But my robot doesn't stop rotating. I think that the problem is that robots position doesn't change so it keeps rotating and doesn't move forward. Do you have any ideas of how I can solve this problem.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/15/2021 07:38:06
Check out this code:

[https://github.com/lukicdarkoo/webots-example-visual-tracking/blob/master/controllers/ball\_supervisor/ball\_supervisor.py](https://github.com/lukicdarkoo/webots-example-visual-tracking/blob/master/controllers/ball_supervisor/ball_supervisor.py)



It calculates a position and sets the position of the ball. You can read the position from the external file instead of calculating it at each timestep.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/15/2021 07:58:05
Actually I was wrong. It is possible to clear the console, here is the documentation:

This doesn't look related to Webots. Your `p1` process is accessing to the `robot` instance from the main process. You need something like queues to synchronize them and exchange data. Note that multiprocessing is different from multithreading.

`gaussianWidth` doesn't have any unit, it is just a factor applied to the DistanceSensor aperture to compute the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution of the sensors ray weights.

##### Master.L 03/16/2021 01:24:08
Hello! I have a question.

I want to control the speed of the end-effector of the robot arm, not the speed of each joint. What should I do?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2021 01:24:33
You have to use inverse kinematics


what robot and what operating system are you on?

##### Master.L 03/16/2021 01:28:31
I am currently working on a project on Linux-ROS.

We are also using a delta robot, and we have solved the inverse kinematics of the delta robot to move the end-effector to the desired position.

When moving, I want to control the speed of the end-effector like a motion profile.


I want to include acceleration/deceleration in the speed.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2021 01:35:38
use moveit with ROS for exact motion control


but velocity control for the end effector in cartesian coordinates is not easy. You can do it with jacobian matrices, but you'll get a


an error drift


I managed to do a clean ik velocity control, but it requires IKFast, so you would have to compile a solver for your robot

##### Master.L 03/16/2021 02:20:47
Currently, I have created my own motion profile.

And it calls the position to each joint by rosservice as much as the resolution of the motion profile.

The time\_step is progressed in units of 32mm/s, and the project proceeds by calling time\_step after the joint position rosservice call.

There are several problems with this.

1. For 32mm/s, I cannot check whether each joint has moved to the desired position.

2. Simulation does not move in the middle of execution.

Checking other examples, it was a method of giving the first position once and continuing the time\_step without giving a position every time\_step.

Am I wrong the way I do it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2021 02:26:21
use the trajectory follower example


publish a joint trajectory

##### Elizaveta\_Potemkina 03/16/2021 11:53:28
hey guys, is there a way in webots (using Python) to make the robot wait between executing one function and another? I have a rotational motor that needs to close a claw around an object before a sensor takes a reading. It's called using setPosition, and takes some time to actually get there, but the next line in the code is already to read the sensor, so it doesn't manage to close the claw. I believe time.sleep() wouldn't work, since I've tried to use that for some previous testing but it just stopped the controller for some reason, and I need setPosition to still be executing while the robot waits

##### Chernayaten 03/16/2021 12:02:32
I used a positionSensor to do the exact thing you're trying to do and had it loop through a while function until the diff was small enough. There might be a better way to do it though

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/16/2021 12:33:41
Simply call the Robot.step() method with the number of milliseconds you need to wait.

##### Elizaveta\_Potemkina 03/16/2021 12:41:14
I ended up using a while loop to just iterate +=1 on an integer variable for a few timesteps. Will probably switch to robot.step(milliseconds) to be more efficient

But why a compiler error?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/16/2021 19:41:57
Because the graphics card is too old and doesn't support recent versions of OpenGL and corresponding shading language.

##### reinaldobianchi 03/16/2021 19:42:35
Usually I get the message "This computer does not support OpenGL 2..."


After installation.


This message was very criptic 🙂

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/16/2021 19:43:27
AMD was not very good at being fully OpenGL compliant. This driver may in theory support OpenGL 3.3, but not in practice...

##### reinaldobianchi 03/16/2021 19:44:02
That's why there is no error after installation?


I am a teacher and this semester I am using Webots with 80+ students... I am facing errors I have never seen before 🙂

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2021 20:12:20
`@reinaldobianchi` Webots requires 3rd gen intel cpus. For more detail, you can check this link. [https://www.katsbits.com/codex/blender-opengl-compatibility/](https://www.katsbits.com/codex/blender-opengl-compatibility/) OpenGL 3.3 has to be supported

##### reinaldobianchi 03/16/2021 20:14:10
Yes... What happened is that I trusted that the GPU was OK when no message of error or warning appeared after I installed it. Usually old or incompatible GPUs are screened out really fast...


This one wasn't.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2021 20:14:41
ATI Radeon HD 4350 should be supported. Perhaps the driver needs an update

##### reinaldobianchi 03/16/2021 20:15:46
Already did that... bus it is an old GPU...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/16/2021 20:17:10

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/18/2021 17:36:50
You cannot control motors or read sensors from the other robots, but you can change everything in the scene tree (for example translation/rotation of the robots). You can use emitter/receiver to send and receive data from the other robots:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)

##### Götz 03/18/2021 17:37:53
Okay, thanks a lot!


And another one... 😉

I'm running a world with 10 robots which are controlled via REST API calls on an AWS GPU instance. I'd like to give access to the visualization of the simulation to students who **control their robots** but **not to the full Webots** interface. I've tried the streaming server and it gives me very bad performance and nearly eats up all of my laptops CPU. Using a VNC connection to the AWS instance works, but then I have to stream the simulation to the students using web conferencing software.

Is there any other way to get the simulation from a headless server to viewers?

I've read in the news section a new web UI is coming up, would this help in my case?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/18/2021 17:49:16
In general, the web streaming should produce a minimal overhead. Did you use `x3d` or `mjpeg` streaming?

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-streaming](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-streaming)

##### Götz 03/18/2021 17:49:29
X3D


Didn't get mjpeg to work...


I was a bit surprised myself about the performance.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/18/2021 17:55:22
Just to check, everything is fine on the server, but your laptop has performance issues just by showing the simulation in a web browser?

##### Götz 03/18/2021 17:59:17
Yup, this is how it looks to me. So the client should not get a lot of load during streaming?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/18/2021 18:00:33
No, I don't think we have ever had similar problem

##### Götz 03/18/2021 18:00:37
I better test with another client then...

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/18/2021 18:01:06
What about this simulation:

Hello everyone, I have just begun using Webots and I have a question about transferring code to a robot. I read the documentation on the website, but it wasn't very clear. My group and I are trying to build a small drone and a robotic arm. We are probably going to use an arduino and I was wondering how can I cross-compile a webots controller code into arduino code (I think it is c++)


Also, does it matter if our webots controller is in C++ or Python ??

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 08:00:48
It all depends if your arduino board support C++ and Python. The idea is to write a wrapper between the Webots API and your hardware.


See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/transfer-to-your-own-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/transfer-to-your-own-robot)

##### James Le Poidevin 03/19/2021 08:24:51
Hello, I just wanted to know if there was anything integrated in webots that allows me to projected the FOV of a camera onto the floor or will i have to pas directly by openGL ?(For example for a NavCams or LocCams on a rover)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 08:45:03
Not sure to understand your question... Do you want to see the intersection of the camera frustum with the floor?


Did you check the View menu, Optional Rendering, Show Camera Frustum?

##### James Le Poidevin 03/19/2021 09:02:12
Something like this

%end


But only show like a square on the floor showing what the robot can see

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 09:19:07
Well, I believe this is not directly possible, but the View menu, Optional Rendering, Show Camera Frustum option will let you see what the robot see at the top of the frustum.

##### James Le Poidevin 03/19/2021 09:21:40
Ok thank you i'll look at OpenGL to see if it's possible . The Camera Frustum is good but the Frustum doesn't touch the ground so it won't work for what i need.


Hello again, I have a question about implementing a bogie (like what is on the sojourner), I've go the exact same hinge joint config as on the sojourner but mine messes up sometime. It often works fine but on some occasions it's as if the joint goes solid. (cf video)
> **Attachment**: [Bogie-test.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/822455077415026708/Bogie-test.mp4)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 13:14:19
It looks like the left and right joints are connected, isn't it?

##### James Le Poidevin 03/19/2021 13:15:29
Yes it's 1 solid from the wheel on the left to the one on the right (of the bogie)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 13:21:12
Then depending on the constraint on the other side, the behavior you get may be normal, isn't it?


If you would like to see the same behavior as the sojouner, you should probably decouple the left and right hand sides.

##### James Le Poidevin 03/19/2021 13:30:45
I have the same config as the Sojouner 1 Solid -> hinge joint(with no devices) -> 1 solid connected to the two wheels

##### pnaraltnsk 03/19/2021 18:20:32
Hi, I have implemented the code and the calculations worked fine but when I try to rotate my robot, since the angle values changes unexpectedly, it keeps turning. For example, angle value changes from 44 to -110. Is there a way to fix this? What am I doing wrong? Thank you in advance.

##### Seedow 03/19/2021 22:07:47
Hey everyone!

I am trying to put together a robot with a distance sensor on it, for navigation and mapping purposes. I ran into a problem when I try to import 3D models for walls (tryed .stl and .obj files, exported from Autodesk Inventor or Blender).

As you can see on the attached video, the distance sensor returns the distance to the furthermost wall of the mesh that's in range. I also tried it with the Webots box shape, and it's working properly. The mesh is in the shape node of a Solid, and the bounding object of the solid is referenced to the shape. I tried with laser and generic sensor types.

Did anybody have any similar experience importing meshes? Any idea how can I overcome it?

how do i add an image texture to a Wall or Solid?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 22:18:43
<@288787843042770945> This problem was solved already for indexedFaceSets, are you using the latest version of webots? Otherwise what might be causing the issue is if the normals of the faces aren't pointing in the right direction (they should point out of the solid, not in. You can visualize them from the optionalrendering under View menu)


`@Icy_Flurry` did you add a Shape children to the solid?

##### Icy\_Flurry 03/19/2021 22:20:21
no, ill try that


that did it, thanks!


wait, i cant see the image


do i need to do something to make it visible?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 22:38:16
`@Icy_Flurry` set the image in the baseColorMap and define a geometry for the object in the Shape

##### Icy\_Flurry 03/19/2021 22:40:55
what should the geometry be defined as?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 03/19/2021 22:43:58
Depends what you're trying to do, for a wall you can use a Box

##### Icy\_Flurry 03/19/2021 22:44:33
that worked, thanks

##### Seedow 03/20/2021 00:30:10

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/20/2021 10:36:16
We have dozens of automated tests running in our CI, testing most of the API functions, physics, parser, rendering... We make sure they all pass before the nightly builds. Stable releases are tested manually in addition to the automated tests.



A few important things to note about the nightly builds:

- There are revisions and new versions. In the revisions, we are trying not to break the API, but only to fix the bugs. In the new versions, we are introducing new features and changes.

- A documentation targeting the new revision is available with the `?version=master` suffix, while documentation targeting the new version is available with the `?version=develop` suffix. For example [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop)

- By using the nightly builds you are helping us by reporting bugs before the release.

- If you need a specific bug fixed and you need to be on the safe side it is a good idea to pick a nightly build that works well with your simulation and stick with it.

Hello, I am trying to calculate the angle between a target point and Nao robot. I tried to do vectoral angle calculation but it does not give correct result. Any ideas of how to do this? Sorry if the question seems a bit odd I am new to webots.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/20/2021 21:50:17
`@aslisevil` I assume you only need the 2D angle (Thetha) around the vertical axis


for that use atan2()


in python it should be:

from math import atan2

theta = atan2(x1-x2, y1 - y2)

##### Max\_K 03/21/2021 13:55:04
Hello. I am working on a Gripper mounted on a robot. Does someone know why my fingers of the Gripper does not collide with any objects while i move the robot. And why do my fingers disconnect from my model and hanging around at the original position when i moved the robot and let an object collide with the fingers?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 17:32:06
`@Max_K` which gripper on which robot? how did you attach it?


`@watchdogs132` under world info > contact properties, you can specify the friction between two materials. All these settings only apply to interactions between those two materials

##### Max\_K 03/21/2021 17:39:31
Thanks for the reply. It's an self-desigend 3F-Gripper which grep objects from above on a robotino3. I exported the gripper from blender as .dae and created some hingejoints with the finger as EndPoint. I solved it meanwhile by applying first a Transform->Connector->and then Hingejoint.

Now I am trying to pick a puck or small cylinder, but it just falls to the ground. Is there something like a glue?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 17:41:44
you only need a connector node if you want to connect and disconnect something dynamically


I'd recommend you open the ure.wbt sample world and right click on one of the robots and convert it to base nodes


and have a look how they are structured. it's the universal robotics arms with a 3f gripper attached to them

##### Max\_K 03/21/2021 17:45:21
ok there is an connector node for picking with 3f gripper the bottles?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 17:45:45
no, you should use the fingers and the physics interactions

##### aslisevil 03/21/2021 18:59:54
thank you for the feedback but unfortunately it did not work. To calculate I took robot's rot vec and target's translation vector. Results were incoherent.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 19:33:35
`@aslisevil` the x and y values in my example were the both the translation values


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse\_trigonometric\_functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions) take a look at that picture on the right side.


so you should use the atan2 function, and put in the distances in the 2 horizontal axis


that should be the values from the translation vector of both


Of course this only works, if both are in the same coordinate system (world)


`@aslisevil` what programming language do you use?

##### Zändi 03/21/2021 20:33:36
hi guys 🙂

how can I average 3 output values from the robot E-Puck and use this for further processing?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 20:37:02
`@Zändi` just get all 3 values, and then do with those values whatever you want.  The simplest would be` v_avg = (v1 + v2 + v3)/3`

##### Zändi 03/21/2021 20:41:40
thanks, how can I declare v\_avg? 

my basic is: 

double left\_ir\_value = left\_ir->getValue();

double right\_ir\_value = right\_ir->getValue();



i want the average of the left\_ir\_value (infrared sensors for line following)


double left\_ir\_avg;

 left\_ir\_avg = (left\_ir\_value + left\_ir\_value + left\_ir\_value)/3;

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 20:44:56
that is programming basics

does this make sense?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 20:45:07

I am a beginner, sorry

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 20:45:50
with Python I can help, but this is not webots specific. Just google online how to set and manipulate variables


and if you are a total beginner, you might want to research a bit, on what language to learn


Unless you are not required to do C or C++ (which one do you use?), I would recommend Python, as it is much easier to understand and more user friendly

##### Zändi 03/21/2021 20:47:30
Thank you. I must use c++

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 22:37:13
all those calculations use Radians


you have to convert your rot\_degree into radians


rot\_radian = rot\_degree * pi / 180

##### pnaraltnsk 03/21/2021 23:09:03
Thank you, it worked!

##### aslisevil 03/21/2021 23:32:46
thank you for the response. Currently, I am able to calculate the angle correctly. When Nao starts with 1.57 rad angle, it rotates correctly towards the target point. But when it starts with a different angle it fails to rotate correctly. 'target\_angle' is the angle that is calculated with atan2. I tried to subtract target\_angle from nao\_angle which is the angle in axis-angle. But it didn't work. 😦

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/21/2021 23:41:54
is the nao angle correct? This code can only work, if the axis in the rotation field points straight up


and why do you take -y?


just use the relativeY in atan2


and remove the `if target_angle` The angle given is still in radians


I'd really recommend using radians only. Degrees screw things up


pi = 180 degrees. 2*pi is a full circle.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/22/2021 06:59:17
Any `Solid` object whose `recognitionColors` field is set can be recognized from the `Camera.Recognition` functionality:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition)

Some of the distributed objects (cars, street furniture, etc.) already have the `recognitionColors` field set, but if not you can set it yourself just by modifying the PROTO. Here is an example:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/balls/protos/SoccerBall.proto#L47:L49](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/balls/protos/SoccerBall.proto#L47:L49)


Which version of Webots are you using? Do you get any errors in the Webots console?

Did you try first to stream directly from Webots without starting a session server and a simulation server, i.e. as explained in the `Web Streaming`([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-streaming](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-streaming)) section?

##### Timcampy 03/22/2021 08:18:12
Hi, i am new to webots and i need help. The controller that i want to compile, does not want to compile. The error is makefile: no such file in directory. Does anyone know how to edit the INCLUDE variable from the Makefile to link to the correct directory?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/22/2021 09:53:41
Hi, you can find some documentation in the header of `Makefile.include` that should be linked in your controller `Makefile`:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/resources/Makefile.include](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/resources/Makefile.include)

If your header and source files are not located in the root folder of the controller, then you have to set the `INCLUDE` and `C_SOURCES`/`CXX_SOURCES` so that they contain your files.

Here there is an example:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot\_control/Makefile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot_control/Makefile)

It is actually way to slow, running on a AWS GPU instance. And I get the "...your world may be to complex..."


I've stripped down as far as I can, no shadows and so on. I've tried working the basic timestep, but below 16 nothing is moving anymore, works with 24 or 32... but really slow.


Is there any hope this can be done in the first place or is having 12 robot instances just too much? It works pretty nicely with, say, 4 robots. But even than I get the "too complex" warning...


Any hints would be highly appreciated!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/22/2021 13:13:25
Your simulation seems to be relatively simple. In general, it should work just fine. Can you try deleting the nodes to identify what causes it work slowly? Try putting the `controller` field to `void` to isolate the impact of the controllers on the performance.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 03/22/2021 13:16:15
`@Timcampy` they're not the same, the second one has `oldX = Y` and the first one `oldY = Y`. Also it freezes because of the infinite loop, you don't change `Theta` so `newTheta` is always bigger than it.

##### Götz 03/22/2021 13:30:53
Hi Darko, do you mean reducing the number of robots? Or other non-robot nodes?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/22/2021 13:33:06
Both. Start by choosing a simple controller just move them around and then deleting the nodes, one by one, and comparing the performances

Hi, you should have a look at the `Camera.recognition` node:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition)

This node has a segmentation functionality to automatically generate this kind of images. If you just need to get the car, then you could unset the `Solid.recognitionColors` of the other nodes.

Here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/worlds/camera\_segmentation.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/worlds/camera_segmentation.wbt)

##### Dorteel 03/22/2021 16:01:52
Yes it is. And I saw that the transform node has a Position tab where I can see the relative position to the frame, but I'm not sure how to access it from a Supervisor node

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/22/2021 16:05:25
Hello `@Dorteel`, you have to calculate it:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation)

search for `Python Example`.



From the Supervisor node, you can either get the absolute pose of the a node or relative pose to the first parent node. Anything else you have to calculate.

Sigh... seems to be my controller, sim runs fine with a very basic collision avoidance Python controller even with 12 robots. My controller is actually a Python Tornado app going into a loop, listening for API commands and executing them. Finding the issue might be well beyond my dev capabilities, are there any things that come to your mind I could look for?  😔

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/22/2021 17:58:25
`@Götz` "world may be too complex" warning has nothing to do with the GPU. The limit will be the CPU. And it is usually limited by the speed of a single core. This makes servers less suited, as they have many weak cores.


It would be good to find out where the bottleneck actually lies.


Is every controller running in its own process (12 controllers for 12 robots)? or is it one controller running 12 robots?


I can take a look if you want

##### Götz 03/22/2021 18:00:38
Every robot is starting an instance of the python controller with customData=<portnumber>, the controller is then opening this port for the robot.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/22/2021 18:01:34
send me your project and I can take a look

Thank you for your reply .  I want to know do I have to set the friction coefficient between the surfaces in that field ?. In the sample world 'track' the coulomb friction is set at 300. However when it comes to coefficient of friction usually the values are like 0.5 0.6 something like that .

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/22/2021 18:37:09
I assume the friction was set to something that high as a workaround, to ensure non slip. If nothing is defined, default values are used


`@watchdogs132` [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties?tab-language=python) these are the default values

What does the controlPID field do for rotational motors? I'm not seeing any changes when I'm setting different values for PID..


I'm essentially trying to draw a square but it isn't drawing a perfect one because of real world constraints, so I assumed changing values in the controlPID field would improve the robot's performance but that's not the case..

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/24/2021 02:23:44
`@Srivastav_Udit` Can you show us the issue in more detail? And you might want to read up on the documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor)


but in general you should not have to change the PID values.  Webot's default method of controlling motors is very stable. Perhaps you can show a video of you project

Hello I have a question.

I am trying to implement a vacuum gripper in webots.

I know you can use connectors to make vacuum grippers.

You need to add connectors for both the gripper and the box.

If so, should I add the connector to the child after converting the box to convert to base node?

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 03/24/2021 08:44:17
Hey guys. In robocup we are using simspark in 3d-simulation league and we have a DRL framework with stable-baseline/ppo to learn kicks/walking etc. For the virtual competition this year I've implemented a external controller and connect it to our DRL, so I am able to learn in webots as well. Now I want to paralize  this process by using multiple simulation instances, but here's the problem: either the docker approach nor native (starting multiple webots instances and define WEBOTS\_PID to select instance\_X) is working. With docker I can't connect to the running instance inside the container (extern controller running locally/outside), with native webots instances it seems that the WEBOTS\_PID is ignored/not parsed correctly, cause it is always connecting to the same instance. I've seen some posts of solutions but no documentation is working. Would be nice if someone could help me? Further details: DRL implemented in Python, Controller/Behavior logic in Java (Client-Server communication between both)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/24/2021 08:46:06
Although it kinda works, the Connector is not the ideal way to model vacuum grippers. See details on this issue: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2889](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2889)

##### Master.L 03/24/2021 09:02:09
Thank you `@Olivier Michel`. But I don't understand the content of the link you sent me.

Can you make it in a different way now than the way I said?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/24/2021 09:08:10
We should actually modify Webots to extend the connector node, so that it can connect with any solid node and works like a suction cup. Using a Connector node as it is currently implement doesn't work well to simulate a vacuum gripper.


I believe the modification of Webots is not very difficult, but is not on our roadmap yet. Any contribution (including from you) is welcome.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/24/2021 09:13:57
You can set a  `WEBOTS_TMPDIR` for each Webots instance and controller pair. See about the `WEBOTS_TMPDIR` here:

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 03/24/2021 14:45:43
thanks for the hint, this brings me a bit closer to the solution. now I'm able to start multiple webot instances and connect to it with separated extern java controllers. But with the current approach (start ThreadPool and each thread create a new controller to specific webot instance) it crashes, since only 1 robot class should be created. So may I have to look for other controller-creation logic 🙂

Hi guys, I'd like to connect the part on the left to the three links on the right. But I have no idea how to do it. Could you give me any advice? It is a closed-loop mechanism. By the way, I read through this tutorial:[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot) and I think it is an open-loop system. I tried it myself and had no problem.

The local coordinate of the part on the left is not on the joints.

Thank you, `@Darko Lukić`. I checked this model before. Do I need to move the part on the left to the correct pose so that the anchors of the three HingeJoints can be defined correctly?


Additionally, if the parts are connected correctly, when I control the rotation of the top link, will the lower two links (without control) rotate accordingly?

Hi! In the Webots, is it possible for two epuck robots to communicate via Bluetooth using python apis?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/24/2021 23:18:49
`@Isha` Webots includes a transmitter and emitter node, which can be used for communication.


`@Rico Schillings[Sweaty]` I used stable baselines with parallel webots instances in the past. I'll pm you 🙂


`@main` [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor) if a robot controller is a supervisor controller, it has all the normal robot controller functions, but expands its capabilities to do pretty much anything. Read the documentation to get an overview of all its functions

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/25/2021 07:10:33
Beware that when you start Webots on Linux, there are two process created, one is named `webots-bin` and the other one is the launcher, called `webots`. The `WEBOTS_PID` variable correspond to the first one. You can check it by listing the content of the`/tmp/` folder which should contain a sub-folder with named `webots-PID` where `PID` is the value you should set in `WEBOTS_PID`. Let me know if that helps.

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 03/25/2021 07:59:20
Thanks for this additional hint. Meanwhile I can connect to multiple instances, as well with the `WEBOTS_TMPDIR` solution of `@Darko Lukić` as also by reading the `WEBOTS_PID` from the subfolders you mentioned (even if modifying env-vars is not straight forward inside a java runtime..). But as already told, I have the problem with multiple robots per thread, so its only working with separated JVMs for each robot. So currently I am looking to switch to multiprocessing instead of multithreading in java or even switch our controller logic to Python to use its multiprocessing library and re-write our communication between java-python for the learning process

Hello, I'm trying to run webots on fast mode but it doesn't do anything and runs like normal, I tried doing it with the menu option simulation > fast and also by running webots with the flag --mode=fast , none of the options worked. Anyone knows how to fix this? thank you

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/25/2021 09:26:40
Normally the speedometer should indicate a value above 1 if your simulation is not too complex. Otherwise, it should display a value below 1 and the fast mode makes indeed no difference with the run mode in this case.

##### danielvicente 03/25/2021 09:27:24
the speedometer remains about the same in both modes, is that normal?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/25/2021 09:27:37
Yes, if it's below 1.


It means you are running Webots at the maximum speed.

I tried looking at the example with the cylinder\_stack world, but even that doesn't give the right contact points (it gives 4 contact points when the red cylinder is just in freefall). Can anybody explain how these points work or how they could be calculated?

##### Götz 03/25/2021 12:04:32
I'm getting into the InertialUnit to have my robots turn more exactly. So me not having an engineering background... when I test, I get these values (right are IU readings): 
```Right turn

0 rad / 0 Deg = 0.05
1.5708 rad / 90 Deg = 1.57
3.14159 rad / 180 Deg = 3.14
4.71239 rad / 270 Deg = -1.57
6.28319 rad / 360 Deg = 0.05
```

So first thing: what is the smartest way to convert the values  into degrees from 1-360? Or even rad, but consecutive...


And then: when I use an IU to control turns, I do have to turn a bit, get yaw value, turn a bit... until I reach the desired angle. Right? So I would have to call robot.step on every loop run? Does this make sense perfomance-wise?


Thanks!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/25/2021 12:09:56
You can measure difference between two steps, if it is bigger than let's say 0.3 rad that means it means the robot has crossed 0/2pi


That's how a controller works in general


Did you set `includeDescendants` to `true`?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/25/2021 12:29:59
What is displayed in the Webots with white lines is the boundingObject and it is never "filled" but just displays the wireframe.

However the graphical object should automatically be displayed (as "filled"). If it is not, then you should first check if maybe the faces viewed from the back instead of the front. The IndexedFaceSet.ccw field lets you specify if faces are defined clockwise or counter-closkwise.

If this still doesn't solve the issue you should check if any warning is printed in the Webots console.

##### James Le Poidevin 03/25/2021 12:35:58
Sorry when i meant "filled" i mean that items could not pass in between the wires. I have a mesh in meshlab that i export in .stl (or .dae ...) and i want to use it as a floor for my simulation but the objects fall though it.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 03/25/2021 12:37:49

0/2pi...? TBH I still don't get it. How do I handle the IU value going up and then at 3.14 rad turning negative and going down? But hey, I'm perfectly aware you can't provide engineering 101 support here... I'll try to figure it out. Thanks!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/25/2021 19:16:00
`@Götz` Take this image. If you turn counter clock wise, at 180° you have 3.14 (pi) radians. But instead of going up from there to describe the angle around the origin, you can start at 0 ° / 0 rad, and go clockwise. The values will become negative: -90° (- pi / 2) until you reach -180° (-pi). A Full circle is 360° or 2*pi. but you can just move it and define it from -180° to 180° and -pi to pi.

%end


So if you were going counterclockwise increasing the angle more and more, once you pass 180° (pi), you would immediatly jump to -180° (-pi) and keep going from there


This jump is the major reason why Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) are usually not used for describing absolute orientations. Doing calculations with those can lead to issues around that jump. That's where axis angles, quaternion and Rotation matrices are far superior. But they are much harder to understand and less intuitive. For your current purpose euler angles should be enough

##### Westin 03/25/2021 20:44:19
Does anyone have advice for modeling a joint that is actuated using a linear actuator between the two segments? I made the lower and upper parts connected with the hinge, but I'm not sure how to make a slider joint also connect. It kind of ruins the robot tree since it makes a loop. I tried using DEF, but the node wouldn't show up when I was selecting the other end of the slider. I guess if this isn't possible, I could just use a normal motor and model the differences in the controller.

`@Westin` closed loops are very difficult. it is often easier to 'fake' the linear actuation by putting a motor into the joint.

Okay, thanks for the tip. I'm not totally sure I'm able to do what I want, but I think I will be using a joint like this in a variety of scenarios with different configurations, and I'd like to get it right and parameterize it in a proto file. In the long term, that may be easier than faking it each time a bit different.


Is this what the tree should look like? I'm unsure whether the two hinge joints on the right side are required. I could see that going either way. I think I have all of my joints facing the right way, but I get no movement as I move the linear motor. The top and left solids are the two segments of the joint.

Hello, I am trying out the supervisor and robot API after completing tutorials. I have my script based largely on the materials from tutorial 6 (the 4-wheelers bot). However, I'm a bit stuck with what I need to do to get it to import a new wheel to attach to the bot, set the name, modify the hingeJoint parameters and such since I noticed that some of the parameters are immutable (such as the Device type which only has get\_name). I want to change the name for the imported new wheel so that I don't have duplicates in case I want to import additional wheels from the exported wheel prototype "HingeJoint.wbo." I also tried to modify the field directly (such as name) with the code "wheel.name = 'somename'" but to no avail. Could someone give me some pointers as to how to accomplish this in python?


Sorry for double posting, here's a screenshot of what I'm trying to do: the bot at the center top has one of the wheels deleted at the start of the simulation, whereas the center bottom image shows the bot gained a new wheel as a result of running my code. I tried various ways based on the doc to try to change a new name and modify the hingejoint and such while the simulation's running, but to no avail:

You can use the `wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string` function instead:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)



Before passing the string to the function simply replace the name and everything else you need.

Thanks Darko, I've just got it working with the following (gonna post it here for others): 



def experimentAddWheel(robotHandle):

    node = robotHandle.getSelf()

    children = node.getField("children")

    # 0 corresponds to position: 0 - beginning of children

    children.importMFNode(-1,"HingeJoint.wbo")

    wheel = children.getMFNode(-1)

    #print("wheel is {0}".format(wheel.getField("device")))

    devicename = wheel.getField("device").getMFNode(-1).getField("name")

    #print("before change: {0} ".format(devicename.getSFString()))

    devicename.setSFString("blahblahblah")

    print("Type--- {0}".format(type(wheel)))

    #print("after change: {0} ".format(devicename.getSFString()))

    

    #field = node.getField("translation")

    #field.setSFVec3f([0.1,0.1,0.1])



    endpoint = wheel.getField("endPoint")

    name = endpoint.getSFNode().getField("name")

    name.setSFString("somenamehahaha")

    #print(name.getSFString())



    #test code for existing wheel2

    #wheel = children.getMFNode(2)

    #devicename = wheel.getField("device").getMFNode(0).getField("name")

    #print("before change: {0} ".format(devicename.getSFString()))

    #devicename.setSFString("blahblahblah2")

    #print("after change: {0} ".format(devicename.getSFString()))



Unfortunately, I ran into another problem. The "wbo" file has a predefined name "wheel1", so when I run the sim with a new name "blahblahblah" for that particular importMFNode motor, for some reason, the robot only shows the old name "wheel1". It doesn't seem to "refresh" the name of devices when I use getDeviceByIndex(). here's my code and output:

You should restart the controller if you change the name like that

##### Uanuan 03/26/2021 08:28:09
thanks, how should I do that? I did try supervisor.\_\_init\_\_() but it seems to get stuck in an infinite loop. I think it reruns my\_controller.py again and again while trying to add wheel1 into the children node, which then generated an error with a message like: wheel1 already exists.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/26/2021 08:34:05
You can use the `wb_supervisor_node_restart_controller` function:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_restart\_controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_restart_controller)



Before adding the joint and restarting the controller make sure that the new joint doesn't exist in the robot. That way you will prevent the infinite loop.

##### Uanuan 03/26/2021 08:34:55
Great, thanks again Darko, appreciate it. I'll try out the method later 🙂

##### Ruchi 03/26/2021 13:19:42
Hello!!

Can we have communication between webots simulator being the laptop and any bot in environment.

Because as far as I know two epucks can communicate with emitter and receiver node but not sure about the case I mentioned.

##### main 03/26/2021 18:11:47
what does a red bounding box usually mean?


Are objects with colliding bounding boxes allowed to move together in space? say a robot leg made of multiple shapes with overlapping bounding boxes

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 03/26/2021 18:27:02
`@main`  they turn red when a collision occurs. Consecutive solids (two solids linked by a joint) don't trigger it, but if there's a third layer, that one can collide with the first. Internal collisions like these only occur if the selfCollision field at the level of the robot is enabled, otherwise all of them are ignored.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/26/2021 19:26:48
Can you elaborate on what exactly you want to achieve? In general a Supervisor controller can get and set any information in a simulation.

##### Pancha 03/27/2021 17:41:31
Is there some way of simulating a suction cup (a type of gripper)? I have an arm with a suction cup on the end which would work in the same fashion as a pick-and-place robot.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/27/2021 17:51:44
`@Pancha` there is the connector node, this could be used for suction gripping, however, you can only attach and detach two connectors, not grip an object at any spot you like

##### Pancha 03/27/2021 18:52:02
I'll take a look at this. Wouldn't be the most optimal solution, but it pushes me in the correct direction. Cheers 🙂


One more question, which seems rather simple, but I haven't found a proper solution for it. Is there any way to rearrange the order of nodes under a children other than cut --> pasting? This seems to be an issue when I'm using DEF and other nodes inherits from this one. When I add a new node (or copy-pastes) it appears on top of the hierarchy and can therefore not inherit from a DEF further below.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/28/2021 00:03:44
`@Pancha` you can select any of the children (so it is highlighted). Pasting or adding a node, adds it underneath the highlighted child

Usually, from the NVIDIA control panel, you can add any program manually selecting the application from the file manager.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/29/2021 06:34:07
When adding new programs to the list, the file manager opens. Then you have to navigate to the installation directory. Did you do it? or did you simply checked in the list of applications already available by default in the NVIDIA control panel programs list?


Another options, but I don't remember exactly if it works, would be to set the NVIDIA GPU as default for all the programs, launch Webots and then check again if Webots is in the list of programs in the NVIDIA control panel.

Does anyone know what the delay function of C language in webots is

##### AleBurzio 03/29/2021 11:48:48
Hello, I have a question on ros2 + webots for vehicles. 



I have tried the webots\_ros2\_tesla package and it works fine (even though lane\_follower crashes whenever the yellow line is not detected, e.g. in crossroads because a division by zero happens somewhere), but when I tried applying the extern controller on a car in a different world it starts running significantly slower (about x0.2-0.3 vs tesla world x0.8-0.9) as soon as I start acquiring camera data. 



I thought the problem was the basic time step in my world being a lot smaller but they're both set to 10, so I'm not exactly sure what could be causing this issue? Is there a setting for camera frames per second? (camera resolution is the same)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/29/2021 11:53:40
Hello, it is a simple example, not robust, but it should not crash, we should fix it.



> I tried applying the extern controller on a car in a different world it starts running significantly slower



Check the camera resolution and the frequency at which you are acquiring and sending the images. I noticed that the bottleneck is on the ROS side, but hopefully it will be better in the future thanks to the FastDDS zero-copy feature.

##### AleBurzio 03/29/2021 11:59:55
thanks for the fast reply, I'll send you a quick video to reproduce the crash



how can I check how fast the image is being acquired? Is this a ROS problem or is there some setting that can force a certain acquisition speed for the camera directly in webots?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/29/2021 12:07:17
You change the camera resolution in the Webots world and the camera publish rate through the ROS 2 driver, see an example:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/d0f772b358252cda6b9e56768e5ec5cf7454a5ff/webots\_ros2\_epuck/webots\_ros2\_epuck/driver.py#L72](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/d0f772b358252cda6b9e56768e5ec5cf7454a5ff/webots_ros2_epuck/webots_ros2_epuck/driver.py#L72)



In your case it should be something like:

```python
self.start_device_manager({'camera_name': {'timestep': 128}})
```



See the available ROS 2 configurations for the sensor devices:

Hello, I am controlling a robotic arm in velocity. I want to switch to position control for the last point of the trajectory. Is it enough to use setPosition(pos) to switch back to that mode ?


The documentation says that using setPosition() when controlling in torque will switch to position control mode but it doesn't say when controlling in velocity


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#force-and-torque-control](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#force-and-torque-control)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 03/29/2021 13:43:00
Yes, it is enough to set the position to switch to position control. Velocity control is only enabled when the position is set to infinity.

`@Olivier Michel` do you think the two hinges noted in the tree are required? Does the slider require that the points it attaches to stay at the same angle throughout movement or can they rotate freely without a hinge to explicitly allow it to?

##### Adra 03/30/2021 13:46:32
Hello to all! I am developing a basic simulator to be able to develop an autonomous navigation system. I'm working with your simulator, but the prototyping of the system goes through Ros2 Foxy. I wrote a controller to drive my robot model and manage its sensors. I want to use an IMU/GPS couple to generate a perfect odometry at first. Unfortunately, I have difficulties to activate the IMU and read its data. The controller is written in Python. The IMU is named in the simulation : inertial\_unit, and I load it via the getDevice() method when initializing my object. In a function belonging to my object, I then try to read the quaternion with the getQuaternion() method. However, the IMU informs me that I am trying to read data from a disabled device.



```
        self.gps = self.robot.getDevice("gps")
        self.imu = self.robot.getDevice("inertial_unit")
        self.odometry_topic = '/odom'
        self.odometry_frame = 'odom'
        self.robot_base_frame = 'base_link'
        self.gps_sampling_period = 10
        self.imu_sampling_period = 10
        self.gps.enable(self.gps_sampling_period)
        self.imu.enable(self.imu\_sampling\_period)
```



```def position_read(self):
        self.get_logger().info('IMU sampling period is : "%f"' % self.imu.getSamplingPeriod())
        self.get_logger().info('GPS sampling period is : "%f"' % self.gps.getSamplingPeriod())
        orientation = self.imu.getQuaternion()
        position = self.gps.getValues()
        stamp = self.get\_clock().now().to\_msg()
```



```[sylvester_controller-3] [INFO] [1617110834.248941546] [sylvester_controller]: IMU sampling period is : "0.000000"
[sylvester_controller-3] [INFO] [1617110834.249945361] [sylvester_controller]: GPS sampling period is : "10.000000"

##### Adra 03/30/2021 15:45:43
I will check with that


this is my device\_manager call : 

```

            'LDS-01' : {'topic_name' : '/sylvester/scan'},
            'inertial_unit' : {'always_publish': True, 'topic_name': '/sylvester/IMU'}
        })
```

I get this error :

```
AttributeError: 'InertialUnit' object has no attribute 'getValues'
```

But I never call getValues() method in my controller.



either I'm not using the IMU correctly or the problem comes from calling a function that doesn't seem to exist in the IMU driver

Is there a way to change the size of the joint axes?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/30/2021 21:07:15
change the size?


the way it is displayed or the actual size?

##### Westin 03/30/2021 21:25:36
`@Simon Steinmann` The way it is displayed. I'm talking about the xyz triad that is visible when the "Show Joint Axes" option is enabled.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/31/2021 00:36:26
`@Westin` you can use "lineScale" under Worldinfo to change the size of optionally rendered lines such as the joint axes

How did you install Webots? From the .deb package, snap or tarball? Depending on the installation method, in particular with the tarball, some additional steps are needed to get ffmpeg properly installed to allow Webots to make movies. This is normally fully documented here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installing-the-tarball-package](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#installing-the-tarball-package)

Hello, I'm using webots with ros2 and using the start\_device\_manager(), it correctly detects that i have 18 motors (6 wheel Protos with 3 motors per wheel with different names each time). The problem is that when I echo joint\_states there is just 6 times the same three motors (should have Wheelmotor1\_1,1\_2 ...). Does anyone have any idea why?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 03/31/2021 12:17:22
Is it possible that you have multiple position sensors for a single motor? This is how the joint state publisher is discovering the motors:

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 03/31/2021 20:35:15
`@benj3110` you can get the orientation rotation 3x3 matrix (R) of the robot and transform your acceleration vectors into those coordinates

* being the dot product


you have to use the supervisor functionality to change the color field of the solid

Hi Olivier, So I changed the Solid node to a Display, and the ground supposed to be white but it showing a different color. Im just wondering If you know how to draw a simple rectangle in webots. Thank you so much Olivier



Here's my code

robot = Robot()



\#make this the output for drawing

ground\_display = robot.getDevice("ground\_display")

 

\#make the output floor white

ground\_display.setColor(0x000000)

 

\#draw rectangle with corner at (0,0), width of 30 and height of 30

ground\_display.fillRectangle(0,0, 30, 30)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/01/2021 21:14:08
you are right, you should do the inverse


rot\_base = np.transpose(rot\_base)


`rot_base = np.transpose(np.array(base.getOrientation()).reshape(3, 3))`


as one line to get R


base being the robot (copied it from some of my code)


np being numpy. For other languages you gonna have to figure it out yourself 😉

Hi guys, I'm absolutely new and just finished the tutorial up to the ROS part (I need to get to know ROS first), and I'll be writing my master thesis with Webots + ROS, so I'll be more active here for the next months probably.



I have a question already: I observed that the software has some troubles with heavy objects (example a 1x1x1m box that falls off of a meter, etc..) that will sink through a plane floor for example, and stop at a certain point. Now I am aware that there might be some heavy numerical operations to solve which can easily lead to unwanted results, but what can I generally do to know that my object will most likely remain above the surface? Is there some kind of a rule of thumb, or is it a pure trial & error for anybody else too?

Cheers, and I'm looking forward to the further input in here.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/02/2021 11:29:38
`@KNTRL` when you notice interpenetration between solids like you mention it's usually that the `basicTimeStep` (in worldInfo node) being used is too big. This is especially noticeable for heavy objects. The physics engine will detect the violation and progressively correct it in the following steps but  the fact remains that the timestep being used isn't suitable. Another factor is the contactProperties (also in worldInfo) between the two objects, you can lower the `softCFM` parameter to get better results.

Hi, 

How can I move a solid object (with physics) on a path in the  supervisor node?  Since physics is enabled if falls when I simply change its position.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/05/2021 08:28:38
`@Ali_1` if the object is supposed to be entirely moved by the supervisor you need to manually set it's translation/rotation field at every timestep. If instead you want the object to have physics but "float"  then you can insert the solid object as a child of the robot, then give physics to the object itself but not to the parent (the robot)

##### Pancha 04/05/2021 15:55:19
I've seen that there's plenty of people trying to get a vacuum/suction gripper to work, but have anyone succeeded and have an example? I'm new to Webots, but I am really struggling with getting this to work. Programming in `Python` for this project.



The idea I have been working around is for an arm to extend out and for it to pick a box by the use of a suction gripper (or electromagnet). This seemed simple enough, but I'm just unable to get the gripper and the box to connect.



So far I've created the arm with a `Connector` node as the end effector on the `Robot` node. In order to allow for the suction gripper to be  locked/unlocked  (`lock()` / `unlock()`) to the box on demand, each box also had to be a `Robot` node with a `Connector` node. So far this works as intended. When extending or retracting the robot over the box I'm printing out `getPresence()` for each connector and I see them change from `0` to `1` when they're in the correct position based on the tolerance of the connector nodes. The issue I then have, which I seem to be unable to work around is to actually connect them together. When moving the robot arm the box doesn't follow.



I've followed various online resources and the `connector.wbt` sample world (programmed in C) which have lead me where I am today.



Hope someone has an idea nudging me in the correct direction 🙂

##### tudor 04/05/2021 16:10:01
Hello Webots community, I have a question regarding proper usage of Supervisor.simulationReset() function. My .wbt file initially cotains only a supervisor robot node with a non-void controller (SimulationController.py). The pseudocode of this controller reads as follows:



    for usecase in usecases:

        Supervisor.simulationReset() # step 1.

        Supervisor.step(64)  # step 2. basicTimestep is 64 as well. This, as far as I understand, is required for SimulationManager.py to communicate the simulation reset request to webots. Without this the robots are never loaded successfully

        load\_robots(usecase) # step 3 . Here I am loading various robots from string. Robots have non-void controllers



        #The following loop lets the simulation run until a preset MyTimeout. After MyTimeout is reached, simulation should reset

        while not self.step(self.timestep) == -1 and now <= MyTimeout:

            now = self.getTime()



This loop runs succesfully for the first iteration, then crashes with a segmentation fault during the second iteration, during step 1. Output messages vary sporadically:

Message 1:

munmap\_chunk(): invalid pointer

Message 2:

Assertion 'newindex >= 0 && newindex < (int) flist->size' failed at pulsecore/flist.c:93, function stack\_push(). Aborting.

Or simply:

./webots: line 90: 30204 Aborted                 (core dumped) "$webots\_home/bin/webots-bin" "$@"





My questions are :

1. Am I doing something obviosuly wrong with the way I am trying to reset my simulation?

2. The documentation seems to me a bit vague in specifying exactly what happens to controllers of programatically created robot nodes when calling simulationReset. Am I assuming correctly, that in my case, when calling simulationReset, the controllers of the robots spawned in load\_robots should be killed, whereas the SimulationController.py controller should continue running?



Thanks for reading!

Dear Friends. I have a doubt about the Sensors on the Pioneer AT3. Is the figure on page [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pioneer-3at](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pioneer-3at) wrong?


It looks like the sensors that are in front should be in the back...


Sensors 0 to 7 should be in the back, and sensors 8 to 15 in the front, no?


I also think that the Front and Back views of the robot are switched...

Hi.


When using this robot, if you move the viewpoit to the front, you will se the robot's back.


Alsi, in this image, sensor so3 is said to be on the front, but it is on the back.


if you move the robot with positive velocity on the wheels, it will move to the real front of the robot.


but if you use sensor s03 as a front sensor, distance to a wall will increase...

Yes, you can extend the `WebotsNode`, see an example:

Hi, I have a question regarding supervisor's getNumberofContactPoints() function. I'm trying to do Reinforcement Learning, where the episode ends when the robot collides with itself.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/06/2021 13:52:47
I have just properly checked and the orientation is correct. The confusion may come from the fact that the Pioneer robot uses a lookup table for the distance sensors:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ab8b93ff30523825a8193327db756f44f12d390c/projects/robots/adept/pioneer3/protos/Pioneer3DistanceSensor.proto#L191-L194](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ab8b93ff30523825a8193327db756f44f12d390c/projects/robots/adept/pioneer3/protos/Pioneer3DistanceSensor.proto#L191-L194)



See details:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)



Closer the obstacle the higher value is. This is done to imitate the real hardware, although I am not sure how accurate it is at this point.



Feel free to open a pull request and propose changes.

##### reinaldobianchi 04/06/2021 13:55:45
Just another question: why the views are wrong?


if you move to the viewpoint "Front", you will see the back of the P3 AT


And vice versa.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/06/2021 13:57:14
Maybe a better example:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_tesla/webots\_ros2\_tesla/tesla\_driver.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_tesla/webots_ros2_tesla/tesla_driver.py)



So, you would have something like:

```python
class YourDriver(WebotsNode):
    def __init__(self, args):
        super().__init__('tesla_driver', args, controller_class=Supervisor)
        self.start_device_manager()
        field = self.robot.getSelf().getField(...)
        field.setSFVec3f(...)

Hi, maybe a simple question but struggling this~ I am trying to use pycharm to run webots controller in Ubuntu. I follow the tutorial of "Using your IDE" chapter, but it returns out this error

ImportError: libCppController.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

How can I solve this problem?

##### Deleted User 04/07/2021 06:13:37
Hello , I wanted to know if there was a webots model for the intel realsense camera .

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/07/2021 07:10:13
Make sure the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is pointing to the correct directory

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/07/2021 07:37:10
You can check whether the configuration works independent from your IDE:

```bash
export WEBOTS_HOME=/usr/local/webots
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller
export PYTHONPATH=${WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller/python38
python3 UR5e_1.py
```

If it works, then the problem is isolated and you can focus on configuring your IDE.

##### Harris 04/07/2021 08:22:21
Do u mean type these in the IDE terminal? Programs can be started in the terminal but it still not work when I press run. Sorry I am new to PyCharm as well..

That's a good sign. Now, you just need to configure PyCharm. Unfortunately, I have close to zero experience with PyCharm.

Hello there ! I have a question about a detail from Webots ros2 sensors messages. It seems that they are not reliable, I need to switch rviz2 topic subscription to best\_effort to be able to visualize pointcloud (for example). Is this normal? Is there a way to get reliable messages?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/07/2021 12:22:02
The newest version of `webots_ros2` (available in the master branch) uses `qos_profile_sensor_data` QoS for all sensors.


I suppose your ROS 2 controller has crashed and it crashed the Webots instance

##### Pancha 04/08/2021 09:06:54
I've seen that there's plenty of people trying to get a vacuum/suction gripper to work, but have anyone succeeded and have an example? I'm new to Webots, but I am really struggling with getting this to work. Programming in `Python` for this project.



The idea I have been working around is for an arm to extend out and for it to pick a box by the use of a suction gripper (or electromagnet). This seemed simple enough, but I'm just unable to get the gripper and the box to connect.



So far I've created the arm with a `Connector` node as the end effector on the `Robot` node. In order to allow for the suction gripper to be  locked/unlocked  (`lock()` / `unlock()`) to the box on demand, each box also had to be a `Robot` node with a `Connector` node. So far this works as intended. When extending or retracting the robot over the box I'm printing out `getPresence()` for each connector and I see them change from `0` to `1` when they're in the correct position based on the tolerance of the connector nodes. The issue I then have, which I seem to be unable to work around is to actually connect them together. When moving the robot arm the box doesn't follow.



I've followed various online resources and the `connector.wbt` sample world (programmed in C) which have lead me where I am today.



Hope someone has an idea nudging me in the correct direction 🙂

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/08/2021 09:17:01
If you are comfortable with C/C++ you can try to implement it in the Webots core:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2889#issuecomment-804073941](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/2889#issuecomment-804073941)



Another idea is to use the Supervisor robot. On each timestep you measure a distance between an object and the suction cup. Once it gets close enough, you stick the object to the suction cup by changing the position/orientation of the object at each timestep depending on the position of the suction cup.

##### Pancha 04/08/2021 09:18:14
Cheers, I’ll try this out 😁👍

##### tudor 04/08/2021 10:26:40
Could anyone please clarify: What happens to controllers of robots created during the simulation, when using simulationReset? Am I right to assume that the get killed by the webots main process?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/08/2021 10:50:58
Nothing, you have to reset each controller explicitly:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop#resetreload-matrix](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop#resetreload-matrix)

##### tudor 04/08/2021 11:12:35
Thanks for the prompt response. Don't you find this behaviour a bit weird ? Say the supervisor adds a robot node with a supervisor at t=10s (using importMFNodeFromString). At t=100s the supervisor decides to reset the simulation, ie bring it to t=0s, where there is no added robot node yet. But the controller of that robot which is not existing anymore is still running? Even if I reset this controller manually from the supervisor, what will it do running from t=0, when it has no robot node to operate on(as again, supervisor will try to create that robot only at t=10s)?

##### Yi Zhou 04/08/2021 11:14:27
Hello everyone, I have got the image array by using python function "getImageArray" from camera, but when I try to show image array by using Pillow, it did not show the image that camera shows on webots, does anyone know what's the reason?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/08/2021 11:20:10
That function returns list of lists in Python. You should use `getImage` instead, see here:

##### Yi Zhou 04/08/2021 11:21:36
Thank you so much, I'll try👍

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/08/2021 11:33:05
Yes, if a robot is created during the simulation, then it is deleted on simulation reset and its controller is automatically killed by Webots.

Controllers of robots that are part of the original world and won't be deleted on simulation reset continue to run.

##### tudor 04/08/2021 12:07:34
Thank you very much, makes sense! As a followup question, am I right to assume that when the supervisor is calling wb\_simulation\_reset, the reset is actually happening only after also calling the step(basicTimestep), because only then the supervisor controller communicates to the main webots process?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/08/2021 12:16:33
The `wb_supervisor_simulation_reset()` request is sent immediately to the Webots main process but it is executed at the end of the ongoing simulation step. So if your robots have the `synchronization` field set to TRUE, yes you can assume that the reset happens when all the controllers call the step(basicTimestep) instruction.

##### Westin 04/08/2021 16:42:18

Hi, this is my first time posting where I could use your help.  Yet as a JrHi/SrHi teacher, I'm excited about Webots as a solution in providing Robotics Education... online esp. during this pandemic season.  I've used a few sim tools (e.g. VRT, RVW) in the past, yet I appreciate the open-source, real-time responsiveness, and web-based features (e.g. RobotBenchmark.net) of Webots.  I need your advise as best practice on sending my students a Zipped File of the 'controllers/protos/worlds' directories - so they can open the .wbt file to test/mod that lesson's sim (kindly see a screenshot of a simple prototype below).  Yet I'm finding that what I create on Win does not load correctly on a Mac, and vice-versa (e.g. a 'Matlab' path issue: 'WARNING: To run Matlab controllers, you need to install Matlab 64-bit and ensure it is available from the DOS CMD.EXE console. ...  Warning: ... failed to start:  !).   What seemed to work is exporting VRML97 - as well as - copy/paste the Controller code into 'File: New World' for that respective Win/Mac platform.  Thus, I need to have *both*  a Win and Mac version for every zip-file-sim-lesson.  Any recommended process to have just 'one' zip file, yet be cross-platform friendly?  Sorry for the long text.  I'm such a newb.  😉

Ah so the wbt file doesn’t work cross-platform?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 04/09/2021 06:24:36
Everything should work cross-platform, especially if your controllers are interpreted language (MATLAB or Python) or Java. For C and C++ controllers, you will need to recompile them from the source, but that's very easy from the Webots IDE.

Hi Olivier `@Olivier Michel` and '! Thonk enthusiast' `@thonk enthusiast` , Thanks for the helpful, timely responses.  Oliver's advice helped tremendously, as the C-based controllers do need a rebuild - via the convenient 'Build' Button - esp. when switching between Win & Mac.  



I only ran into one 'corner case' where the solution may involve a little more TLC, since the sample 'MyBot' - that I'm learning from - features multi-directory controllers: 1) Simple, 2) Camera and 3) Physics.  The first two rebuilt ok, yet the third had difficulty finding the desired controller file for re-building.  To minimize this post from becoming a 'thousand words', a screenshot/picture is being posted.  Thx again for any supportive time on this. 🙂

##### jasonc1025 04/09/2021 20:51:19
Here is a second follow-up where I could use Olivier's and anyone else's help... 🙂



Question 1: Thx `@Olivier Michel`  to suggest that Python could be a solution to bypass this extra-step of manual-rebuilding, esp. when trying to provide a zipped .wbt package to students with either Win or Mac.   I like the idea, yet are there any Python Samples to learn from - similar to the following C Samples: 1) MyBot (nice & simple .wbt & controller file), 2) 4\_Wheels\_Robot (another nice & simple .wbt & controller file), and/or 3) Surveyor (nice tele-op via keyboard - since kids enjoy remote-control action - just as much as autonomous-mode ;).  



Question 2: For my younger students who are still using 'block' programming, would it be advised that I just provide two downloadable zipped-packages - Win and Mac - and they just download, unzip and double-click the .wbt file (assuming they already have Webots installed)?   These are the same students who love the one-URL/Browser approach of RobotBenchmark.net (of which I'm also excited about and could use some help later - exploring the idea of sharing teacher-developed missions via the same platform, as a full curriculum-unit).  Believe me, teaching online under this pandemic has been draining - and I would celebrate the opportunity of not having to worry/support downloadable apps among a hundred+ JrHigh/SrHigh students with various computer types (Win, Mac, iOS, Android, etc.). 😉



Our budget is limited - as we *also* seek to reach out to 'under-resourced' students (feel free to verify our authenticity as I serve as Lead for open-source-based RoboQuest Robotics (second-listed program on [https://questforspace.com/quest-portal/](https://questforspace.com/quest-portal/)), yet I'll be happy to seek my Upper Admin to insure a win-win for everyone.  (Thx for anyone's support towards such a long post.  Now, off to more curriculum-dev.)  😉

##### jasonc1025 04/09/2021 21:04:26
Thx `@Renkun` & `@Deleted User` (cc: `@Olivier Michel`) for asking.  If I understand the question properly, any one given class can have students with a Win, Mac, or iPad (iOS).   Since I don't have enough skill-set to leverage the super-cool 'Web-Sim', we'll need the students to download the Webot desktop on their respective device, as well as download our Sim-Lessons per Zipped-.wbt Package (of which I'm seeking Olivier and others for best-practices advice, such as using *Python* language as a more turn-key solution to 'C' for younger students [no need to rebuild]).   Hope this makes sense. 🙂

Given `@Olivier Michel`  'scope-of-responsibility' in Webots, I appreciate your valuable time  - even via your kind 'thumb-up' emoji - to confirm that I should be in the right direction re: Rebuilding for Win/Mac Controller Code in C.  Now to hopefully learn more about the Python option. 😉


After further browsing, I ran into this exciting news 'The sample players as well as the "automatic referee" are implemented in *Python*, which should allow for easily updating the code to match the rules and *avoid any compilation issues*.' from [https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/).  Perhaps this is a good model to learn how to code in Python for Webots, plus I've been searching for an alternative robotics competition for my students (trying to wean off of FLL [Lego EV3]). 😉  Any other suggested Webots Sims in Python to explore?

For graphical programming of robots in Webots, you might be interested to check this out: [https://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/dev2.html](https://www.stormingrobots.com/prod/dev2.html) (especially the first project with Blockly programming in Webots).

##### Stormtrooper 04/10/2021 12:22:02
(Sorry for posting multiple times, i posted the wrong picture at first)

I'm having trouble with measuring how much the robot's CG is shifting, i need this data to measure the robot's stability margin. I've "borrowed" the code from the  center\_of\_mass.wbt sample from the 'how to' page, but the data produced is very small, even after multiplying by 1000 (i need the data in mm). The data output does seem to make sense though, since it is changing proportionally to the change in my robot's direction.

##### alireza1992 04/10/2021 13:47:34
hi, 

I have a humanoid robot, op3;

I want to know its joint's velocity.

I know that we can read the angular position of each joint from 'getPositionSensor("motor's name") ' ; I want what like this.

I don't want to use gyro sensor in my joints, because gyro get angular velocity respect to global coordinate, so I should do some summations and subtractions to compute the relative angular velocity.

how can I do it?

thanks 🙏

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/10/2021 13:49:49
The motor device has a function called getVelocity()


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor?tab-language=python#wb\_motor\_get\_velocity](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor?tab-language=python#wb_motor_get_velocity)

##### alireza1992 04/10/2021 13:51:50
Thank you for your quick response 🙏 🙏 🙏 .

I need to get current velocity of a joint. However getVelocity() returns the velocity that is specified by setVelocity() method or the maxVelocity parameters in Proto file.

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/10/2021 15:53:52
you can do getPosition at each timestep and calculate the difference in position/timestep to get the velocity

Thx again `@Olivier Michel` for your precious time to support the students/families of which I serve (btw, in 'Silicon Valley', CA).  First Python, and now Blockly... sweet.  As an appreciation for this highly supportive community - as led by Olivier and Crew - I ran into an amazing tutorial for the RoboCupJunior Soccer Sim in Webots... using Python!  This is the best Python tutorial that I've seen so far, where even the Supervisor concept is introduced.  (Based on the educational-quality of this tutorial, perhaps this was developed in-house by Webots?)  😉  And what's so cool about this Webots Soccer Sim... it works turnkey style - unlike other Sim Engines that requires so much more setup/dependencies 'TLC'.  😉  Here is the link: [https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how\_to/](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how_to/)  Cheers.  🙂

##### thonk enthusiast 04/10/2021 19:11:13
So, if I’ve gotten this correct, you’re planning a competition style simulation with Blockly and python using Webots?

##### jasonc1025 04/10/2021 19:37:42
It's a key way to get Jr Highers (younger and older) motivated to learn, yet we wish also emphasize team-vs-team (so no solo lone rangers). 😉

##### Renkun 04/10/2021 19:40:06
thats pretty nice, since Junior Highers like competition. I think its a great idea to motivate students and make the learning process more enjoyable <:tWink:821238815078219826>

##### jasonc1025 04/10/2021 19:57:05
just for fun, no obligation, yet it's kind of nice to learn more about the community here.  I'm from 'Silicon Valley' (South Bay) in CA, USA.  Where are you `@thonk enthusiast`  and `@Renkun`  from(?), assuming i'm not just talking to 'smart bots'.  😉  I assume that we're from all parts of this world?  🙂

Hey! Is it possible to use path planning in webots?

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:49:17
Hi, how can I import a 3D model in webot along with joints and other stuff?

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 14:51:13
webots itself does not have path planning algorithms implemented but you can either implement them yourself or (preferably) use existing implementations

this may be a good refernce: [https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master/PathPlanning](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/tree/master/PathPlanning)

and if you are already using ros then the ros navigation stack is a good option


what format is your model in?

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:51:53
Secondly any material for coding. Actually i am working on project and don't have any idea about coding


Its in stl filw


File


There is a tool, robotic arm pick it and put it in AGV, then AGV moves and again robotic arm pick it and put it on convayer belt.


This is the case scenario.

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 14:54:09
firstly, check if your robot is already included in webots [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots)

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:55:05
I think we can use universal robotic system.


For AGV, i have designed an AGV

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 14:55:58
creating a robot model is quite a long task and an stl does not have all the information that a robot model needs such as the pose of the joints

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:56:33
No i want to instal the tool only


And AGV

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 14:57:20
agv = autonomous guided vehicle ? so just a mobile robot?

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:57:31
Yes


Universal robot is already present


In library

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 14:58:20
do you have a urdf for the mobile robot?

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:58:21
Universal robotic arm.


No

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 14:58:49
do you have a CAD model?

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 14:58:50
Its again designed in fusion 360


Yes

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 15:01:15
if the model is quite complex it can be a good idea to automate the export, you could use [https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf](https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf) in combination with [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots) to get a proto model


if it is not that complex it is probably quicker to model it yourself using the proto language

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 15:02:21
Proto language?

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 15:02:44
there is a tutorial [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto) and an extensive documentation [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto) on how to create these proto models


proto is the format used by webots for robot models

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 15:03:59
Secondly i need to write a script in python. Any source of help?


<@321244789527805964>  thankyou soo much Man.


I was bit worried because i don't have much time. But you really helped me alot.

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 15:08:04
This seems to be a quite complex scenario you are trying to build. Could you elaborate a bit more on how robust this has to be? should the arms just perform preprogrammed motions or do you need to do adaptive motions with some sensing of the part that is being picked up?

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 15:09:59
It is like one cube is placed on table and robot will pick it and put it in AGV.  That AGV travels and reach a place where that part will be picked up by robotic arm.


I need to install a gripper as well


If i could get some tutorial related to this seen. Then it will be very easy. But i could not find on youtube.

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 15:45:11
"should the arms just perform pre-programmed motions or do you need to do adaptive motions with some sensing of the part that is being picked up?" is really the important question, if you have to do motion planning it becomes much more complex

##### umairnaseer21 04/11/2021 15:45:56
No, its just simple motion


Without sensors

##### D26798 04/11/2021 15:46:27

##### Stormtrooper 04/11/2021 15:52:01
Does anyone know how to obtain the distance traveled by a robot's COM during turning/movement (relative to its current position)?

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 15:55:14
what sensors do you have available? do you want to use a supervisor controller (something that you will not have in the real world and is therefore "cheating")

##### Stormtrooper 04/11/2021 15:58:47
Thanks for replying, the robot has Lidar, a distance sensor, accelerometers, GPS, and IMU. And yes i am willing to use a supervisor controller. i miight have it already as i "borrowed" the code from the center\_of\_mass.wbt sample from the how to page. but theres not that much documentation so i dont really understand whats going on that well

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 16:04:10
you have a few options: 

1. for the position you can use the GPS sensor [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps), for orientation you can use your IMU [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/inertialunit](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/inertialunit)

2. you could also calculate the odometry [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odometry) based on how much you wheels have turned (if you have a wheeled robot?)

3. you can request the fields "translation" and "rotation" from the robot node using the supervisor controller [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_field)

##### Stormtrooper 04/11/2021 16:18:31
Thanks again for replying, i dont think i quite understand how these options may help me. sorry but I may have phrased the question wrongly. i meant to ask for the distance traveled by a robot's CG from its COM during turning in mm. As in, the robot's CG should be on top of its COM during constant velocity movement, but when turning the CG should be offset from the COM by a certain distance. i meant to ask how to find this distance?

##### jasper [Moderator] 04/11/2021 16:29:41
it seems like the com is not moving relative to the robot so you can take the reading of the imu and gps at the beginning of the motion and at the end and the difference between them is how much your robot has moved

Thanks also `@jasper` for the Python lead.  For the WeBots Team: might there be plans to build a 'simple' version of path-planning, within WeBots API set, as an educational tool for Jr/Sr High Students & even Adults - like myself - to experiment & learn from?  I understand this is a tall-order, since as an indie-game-developer, path-planning for enemy-bots is a bonus, advanced feature to experience.  So no rush in replying to this   😉


`@jasper` wow, you rock :).  Your 'Tutorial-7-Your-First-Proto' lead brought me to the earlier lesson:  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=python), which helps me convert an existing C-Coded Controller into Python, to avoid the need for rebuilding in a Win/Mac cross-platform classroom-environment (a topic I had posted earlier).  Even all 5 languages are *clearly* featured.  Can't wait to have my Jr/Sr High students to start looking at this.  Super-rocking.  🙂

Hi everybody;

How can I use "supervisor.getFromProtoDef()" in python?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/12/2021 09:26:29
The `getFromProtoDef` is a member method of a node, so you should get the node first. For example, `supervisor.getFromDef('MY_ROBOT').getFromProtoDef(...`

Hello, you can define links manually, see:

Do you get less or more links with `getUrdf`? The link is exported if the corresponding Webots solid node has a name.

##### Yi Zhou 04/12/2021 14:48:38

Can you please send the link of the latest version of webots maybe that's the problem

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/12/2021 20:58:51
`@D26798` you can't simply copy-paste the code snippet from the documentation and expect it to work like you did here 

``` 
namespace webots {
    class Camera : public Device {
      virtual void enable(int samplingPeriod);
      virtual void disable();
      int getSamplingPeriod() const;
      // ...
    }
  }
```

but instead 

```
Robot *robot = new Robot();
Camera *camera;
camera = robot->getCamera("name_of_the_camera");
camera->enable(TIME_STEP);
```



If you're not comfortable with c++ there's other options, and I suggest you follow the tutorials to begin with.


`@KNTRL` very odd, what OS are you on?

Hi guys

I am very new to Webots so apologies if this question is very basic or has been answered already. I want to make a monitor/global controller that would keep track of the positions of all the objects in the environment. I was wondering if it is possible to extract the translation, size, and rotation attributes of all of the objects in the environment. Thanks

You linked /robotis/Linux/project/demo/demo to /robotis/Linux/project/webots*/default*

But Webot generates automatically the code and installs it on OP2 robot.

I think the directory is correct, when I navigate to:

 /robotis/Linux/project/webots/remote\_control/ 



I find this folder, but I find any  remote\_control file inside


but I don't find*


Webot did not install it on the OP2 robot?

%end


Webot is trying to run the follwoing:

/robotis/Linux/project/webots/remote\_control/remote\_control



Which there is no file named "remote\_control" inside remote\_control folder as shown in the image.

Looks like Webot is not installing all the required files? How to solve?

I think "LinuxNetwork.cpp" is causing the problems!

Is there any workaround to run a Webot world file code in the OP2 robot rather than the Transfer window in Webot?

Hi Guys, I'm trying to make a self balancing robot that learns from a genetic algorithm. But I'm unable to restore the position of the robot properly..From my observations it seems the supervisor and controller are out of sync...meaning that when the supervisor resets the robots position the robot controller still keeps on running it motors hence loosing its balance early on, unlike what I want...I don't understand how to get this fixed...Here are the links to the supervisor and controlloer...Thanks in advance...The functions in concern are  **restore\_robot\_position(), run\_optimization(), evaluate\_genotype() ** ***Links :***[https://pastebin.com/H0jnEjN5](https://pastebin.com/H0jnEjN5)     [https://pastebin.com/eyzcPrey](https://pastebin.com/eyzcPrey)

Hello everyone !

I would like to create a world with a robot (6 DOF) which responds as close as from the reality. The most important item I would like is the deceleration of the robot. For exemple, if the robot is doing a very large arm movement (high speed and acceleration), and the robot need to stop, how can I simulate the deceleration from the moment I said stop to the robot ? 

In other terms, how can I get the "real" paramaters torque and velocity (maybe controlPID and acceleration) for each motor ?

Thank in advance

##### Master.L 04/13/2021 09:42:50
hello!

I am trying to do reinforcement learning on webots using deepbots.



What is the difference between emitter-receiver method and supervisor method?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/13/2021 09:46:13
`@bingdong` if you want to control the robot using the keyboard you can use the keyboard functions [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard?tab-language=python)

##### bingdong 04/13/2021 10:05:30
From what I understand, the Keyboard Functions are for key press input. I want to  be able to give a text input of a list according to which the robot simulates.

##### aja\_discord 04/13/2021 10:06:22
supervisor is something like another controller but it has special functions, more that that of the robot class.You can think of it like adding the presence of a human to your simulation.Emitter\_Reciever method is like adding a radio module or infrared module to your robot.You are esentially opening a communication link for the robot...Hope this helps

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/13/2021 10:27:16
I don't see that working well, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. If you have multiple robots that have the same controller but want them to behave differently you can do so using controller arguments [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#using-controller-arguments](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#using-controller-arguments) 

Alternatively, you can create a supervisor that communicates with the robot through an emitter/receiver and sends out that information to the robot at the appropriate time.


The difference and use-cases is explained in the deepbots repository: [https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepbots/blob/dev/README.md](https://github.com/aidudezzz/deepbots/blob/dev/README.md)

Hello everyone,



Can someone help me with my problem?

##### Johan2021 04/13/2021 12:41:27
Hi everyone, I am trying to model a Physics plugin that would perform some action depending on the value of a Connector node's `isLocked` value ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#wb\_connector\_is\_locked](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#wb_connector_is_locked)). I found that ODE provides functions such as `dBodyGetPosition()` to directly retrieve information about the robot, but I was wondering whether there is some functionality that would allow to retrieve (and not necessarily change) the `isLocked` field that is part of the Connector node - being governed by the controller.



It should be possible to send the boolean value of `isLocked` from the controller using the `dWebotsReceive()` function in the plugin and the `wb_emitter_send()` function of an Emitter node - as explained here [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend). But for design reasons I was hoping to avoid this approach. Does someone have more knowledge or ideas on this? Greatly appreciated!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/14/2021 06:59:41
Hello, Webots creates a fixed joint between two connectors when locked:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/180777b4f9114e336eb39f70f8feda42a7ffc552/src/webots/nodes/WbConnector.cpp#L486](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/180777b4f9114e336eb39f70f8feda42a7ffc552/src/webots/nodes/WbConnector.cpp#L486)



Maybe, you can exploit it in the physics plugin


You can set an image to the Display node:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286019/webots-displaying-processed-numpy-image-opencv-python/58298221#58298221](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58286019/webots-displaying-processed-numpy-image-opencv-python/58298221#58298221)

So, maybe you can do it continuously from a controller.



One more idea (that I am not sure about) is to use `wbr_camera_set_image`:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/114ef740e47613c8235022716d7cf0782e383f3a/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote\_controls/e-puck\_bluetooth/EPuckInputPacket.cpp#L127](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/114ef740e47613c8235022716d7cf0782e383f3a/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote_controls/e-puck_bluetooth/EPuckInputPacket.cpp#L127)

and then `wb_display_attach_camera`:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_attach\_camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_attach_camera)



In any case, you need a controller that reads frame by frame from a video file and sends it to Webots.

##### Uanuan 04/14/2021 08:46:34
Hi all, I'm trying (hopefully) to create a socket server that will eventually control a bunch of bots simulated in the webots environment, so I have setup a python server (separated from the main controller thread), and in turn, it listens to connection requests from other programs. One thing I noticed is that the main thread appears to be stuck at 0 when I start the simulation (the timer stays at 0), and it will only spit out a bunch of text when I  terminate the simulation (which kills the server as well). Although the client/server interactions appear to be correct based on my test drivers, I'm obviously doing something very wrong. Can you give me some pointers on how to fix this problem? Here's how the controller code looks like: 

def main():

    robot = Robot()

    

    #sets up the server thread and start it

    server = SocketServer(server\_address, serverStatusCallback, PORT, maxConns)

    server.start()

whereas SocketServer class looks like the following and I've called threading.Thread.\_\_init\_\_(self) beforehand to start the server, so I ddin't get any errors from Python =>

class SocketServer(threading.Thread): <--- when run() is called, it just enters into a loop to listen() and spawn additional threads to handle client connections. In addition, I've also set all of the print to console with flush=True option.

Hello, Is there an example of a ros2 package that doesn't launch a world file but uses one already open (either by another pkg or just by hand)?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/14/2021 09:29:20
No, but you should be able to exclude the Webots world from the launch files and then run only controller

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/14/2021 09:40:16
You should make sure that in your controller program you have the simulation main loop that calls `robot.step(timestep)` otherwise if the Robot has the `synchonization` field set to true the simulation won't advance because it will wait for this controller:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#controller-programming](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#controller-programming)

##### James Le Poidevin 04/14/2021 09:48:10

```  RuntimeError: Included launch description missing required argument 'world' (description: 'Path to Webots' world file. Make sure `controller` field is set to `<extern>`.'), given: [package, executable, robot_name]

``` 

Do i even need to use the `webots = IncludeLaunchDescription(...)` part ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/14/2021 11:00:02
You cannot use `robot_launch.py`, but you can take inspiration from it:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_core/launch/robot\_launch.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_core/launch/robot_launch.py)



For example, to run the controller you need only this part:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/57f8f48121243f24f35675ba1b54b886da8690f4/webots\_ros2\_core/launch/robot\_launch.py#L108-L122](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/57f8f48121243f24f35675ba1b54b886da8690f4/webots_ros2_core/launch/robot_launch.py#L108-L122)



And to run the simulation:

Hi all, I'm very new to Webots and evaluating it against a few other simulators for use at my company. I'm trying to test a number of sensors (eg a few Velodyne LIDARs and a handful of mono cameras) in a reasonably-complex world. However, I'm struggling to understand how I can extend any of the sample robot/car model PROTOs to add these sensors. `@Olivier Michel` suggested I use the extension slots on the BmwX5 model (thank you VERY much for all your help yesterday by the way!) but it would be very helpful if there's some example model I can follow which has a sensor added to a slot.



Alternatively, if there is a simpler way to evaluate a number of sensors please do let me know. Mainly looking to test real-time performance and understand processing limitations. Thank you!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/14/2021 19:38:33
`@Nick R` You can simply add a Robot base node and add all the sensor as children. as controller select 'Void'. run the simulation and right click on the robot in the scene tree -> view Robot Window. Here you can enable the sensors and view them. You can move the robot in the 3d view when selected. And you can move the sensors relative to the robot when you select them.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/15/2021 06:23:59
An independent controller instance is run for each Robot/Supervisor, so you can only create one supervisor instance per controller and use the Supervisor API with the robot associated with the controller.

But you can use the same controller for multiple robots (multiple instances will be started) and identify and use for example the `Robot.name` value to identify it (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_name](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_name)).

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/15/2021 06:53:19
Webots doesn't require solid names to be unique, so we add a suffix to the solid name if there is a solid with the same name. However, it is strange that you are getting the error. Is it a custom robot?

##### Uanuan 04/15/2021 08:32:33

##### Johan2021 04/15/2021 10:13:12
Hi `@Darko Lukić` , thanks a lot for your reply! In this case, the fixed joint would only be created when a compatible peer connector is present - if I understood correctly - which would not necessarily be the case for me. Would there be a way to declare the `isLocked` value as a "global variable" to the simulator or scene tree that could then be read out from the plugin (I am still new with Webots)?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/15/2021 10:55:30
Yes, you can write the start in e.g. `customData` robot field:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot)



And update it using:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_string)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/15/2021 11:18:24
At simulation load the RadarTarget list is initialized using the order in the scene tree. If you then add new targets after the simulation load, the new target is appended to the end of the list.

##### Johan2021 04/15/2021 11:19:27
This is great! Just to make sure; this would mean that the supervisor class and its functions are available to the `plugin` (reading out the value) as well as to the `controller` (setting the value), after declaring the robot node as supervisor?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/15/2021 11:39:52
Unfortunately, I don't think you can access these fields from the Physics plugin. I afraid you need to fallback to your initial idea.

guys, I just added the controller' racing\_wheel' to a BMW5. 

But when I keep my foot on the gas, the speed is so low. Is there someone knowing what the problem is? :smiling\_face\_with\_tear:

sorry It's a BmwX5

##### Nick R 04/15/2021 14:14:01
Yes, this is a custom "robot" created as a Robot base node with two LIDAR sensors as children. The LIDAR names are unique, so I'm not sure what else is preventing this from working. Unfortunately since the robot\_state\_publisher won't run, I can't access /tf and visualize all the data in map frame (which I assume should work if launched successfully)

##### Steven37 04/15/2021 15:12:06
I am trying to create a function to control my 4-wheeled robot by continuously changing the speed of 4 wheels so that the robot can move in random directions. Then, I want to print out the robot's position every 3 seconds using the supervisor. I have coded for that function as shown in the image I attached. However, I did not see the robot's position printed out. Can someone help me, please?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/15/2021 16:45:43
`@Steven37` the condition for it to print doesn't do what you want it to do, variable `t` doesn't change. The function you're thinking of is probably [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb\_robot\_get\_time](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb_robot_get_time) (still need to fix the condition though)

##### ~E 04/15/2021 16:49:57
Hi all,



I am using the e-puck sample bot with the collision detection and pulling accelerometer data for further data analysis. I am using matlab for the code since my school gets paid A LOT of money to use them, and therefore cannot use Python like any other sensible person would (only joking a little bit ;).



I can post my code, but would like to limit how much I post since this is a project for school, and I do not want classmates to find this and plagiarize.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/15/2021 17:14:12
Is it possible to send the robot model to me so I can investigate it? Also, we did some improvements to the URDF exporter in R2021b. Therefore, if it doesn't take too much time then you can try R2021b:

##### ~E 04/15/2021 17:25:27
I just spoke to my professor, and apparently we aren't even supposed to make the robot collide with anything. I can still DM the files to it if you're curious

##### Nick R 04/15/2021 17:36:22
Sure, I can send it, but I'll try to use 2021b instead first (currently on 2021a). Thanks!

Can someone confirm for me that if your basicsteptime = 4, that means that each step is equal to 0.004 seconds (4ms)?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/15/2021 19:29:23
yes


4 is quite small. Usually 16 works quite well


webots is very stable compared to other simulators

##### ~E 04/15/2021 19:30:29
I just have some REALLY high jerk in starting my movement, and my prof wants us to integrate to find velocity


Also, I hate that matlab starts arrays at 1

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/15/2021 20:18:49
😆  I feel you


oh integrate acceleration to fin vel?


I guess when you are only allowed to use the accelerometer. Wheel motors seem more logical


can you show an example of the jerk in starting movement? It might just be a very high torque setting (unrealisticly high).


you can always speed up in a slower and controlled manner

##### geflowers 04/16/2021 04:06:15
Hey everyone, I'm pretty new with working on webots and had a quick question on how to obtain a certain movement with a rotational motor


So the idea is to have this arm begin at this initial position and after a timestep, have the rotational motor kind of "jerk" the arm back to this horizontal position and repeatedly do that

Was recommended to base it off PID control but kinda struggling on getting the rotational motor to move using the created controller


Any ideas or resources I could use as reference to do this?

##### Nick R 04/16/2021 17:26:44
When simulating a VLP-16 LIDAR, I can run the simulation in fast mode at >10x speed. However, if I subscribe to the ROS2 topic for the LIDAR data in any way (for example viewing it in RViz2, or even just echoing the topic), then the speed cuts in half. Is this expected due to the overhead of ROS2 communication? Anything that can be done about it?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/16/2021 20:25:25
By default, the Lidar publishes data every 128ms as data is very large:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/b37b9916f002503148171279a9a4a1051cd1092d/webots\_ros2\_core/webots\_ros2\_core/devices/lidar\_device.py#L44](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/b37b9916f002503148171279a9a4a1051cd1092d/webots_ros2_core/webots_ros2_core/devices/lidar_device.py#L44)



P.S. FastDDS recently published a zero-copy feature that should significantly improve transfer speeds between nodes. This should allow publishing lidar data at higher rates.

##### Nick R 04/16/2021 20:52:22
Would the zero-copy feature work to reduce overhead from webots to ROS2 though? I'm new to ROS2, but that sounds like the concept of nodelets in ROS1


Also, I experimented a bit more and the RTF (realtime factor) actually decreases much more when subscribing to a single camera stream (800x800) than a single VLP16, which I was surprised by. Unfortunately I want to stream several of each of those sensors at once, but the RTF goes down below 1.0 in that case 😦

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/16/2021 21:05:57
`@Nick R` This is a lot of data. 800 * 800 * 4 Byte = 2.5 MB per frame


if you have 30 frames per second (32ms timestep), that is 75MB/s


this can easily saturate a network connection


keep in mind, that this image data is uncompressed


you might want to consider publishing at a lower rate, or turning it into a service or action, only publishing on request

##### Nick R 04/16/2021 21:10:12
Thanks, it does make sense then. I'm actually not sure the output rate, it's the default for the Camera sensor, but I forgot to check on the ROS2 side. Can the data be sent as a compressed ROS2 msg?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/16/2021 21:10:32
I'm actually googling that right now :p

##### Nick R 04/16/2021 21:10:42
I was suprised because in Gazebo, I was able to run at RTF=1.0 for a large number of camera sensors. They must use some zero-copy mechanism under the hood, I should dig further

Hi! I came across some problems while I was working on my robot. 



I defined some additional parameters on the top of the proto and used them in the file with command IS. However webots shows me the error which says that my parameter has no matching IS field.



Next problem occured when I was adding HingeJointWithBacklash. I think that everything is written correctly but I still see error that HingeJointWithBacklash is skipped.



Do you have any ideas what I could have done wrong?

Anyone know why when STL files are used to import models they end up so huge?


I imported a wheel as an stl file but its bigger than the entire scene (should only be a few hundred millimeters by a few hundred) does anyone know how this scaling works?


As i can scale it down to say 0.001 making it small , but i dont know how much to scale it so that the dimensions are identical to the real dimensions of the stl file (hope that makes sense?)

##### SeanLuTW 04/19/2021 06:11:17
Oh, thanks!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/19/2021 06:11:31
There are just two ways to move joints to specific position:

1) use the Motor API to simulate real motor behavior

2) use the Supervisor API to change the joint position field


You could use a position sensor to detect when the joint reaches the desired position. Note that there is the gravity force acting on the joint end solid so you have to make sure that your motor has enough torque to keep the position.

Alternatively, if you don't want to reproduce a real motor behavior, you can use the Supervisor API to immediately set the joint position field.

Here are some examples:

- [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#position\_sensor-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#position_sensor-wbt)

##### geflowers 04/19/2021 06:20:40
Thank you so much! Really appreciate the help

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/19/2021 06:31:33
It depends on the scale. Webots scale unit is meters, when exporting STL you should make sure that the meters scale unit is used as well. Usually graphical editors like Blender give the option to choose the scale unit in the export dialog.

Otherwise, you can simply scale the Mesh node by setting the `Transform.scale`. The correct scale value depends on the scale unit used in the STL file.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/19/2021 06:34:34
`@moris` Hi, which version of Webots are you using? The `HingeJointWithBacklash` proto is available only in the develop branch of Webots, so if you're using anything else it won't find it. Also, did you follow the hierarchy described here for your project? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project#the-root-directory-of-a-project](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project#the-root-directory-of-a-project). As for the other error, I assume you're making your own robot proto. From what you've showed the call to `HingeJointWithBacklash`  looks good to me, could you post more (or send via PM) about the robot proto itself? Might be easier to pin point.

##### Johan2021 04/19/2021 07:43:03
Hi everyone, I am writing a Physics plugin that is supposed to exert a force onto a body at every timestep, but the simulation crashes at start-up pointing to `dBodyAddForce()` or to `dBodyAddRelForce()` when I replace the former. I found an old issue ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/discord/technical-questions-2020?tab-language=c++&tab-os=macos#troy-04242020-01-27-23](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/discord/technical-questions-2020?tab-language=c++&tab-os=macos#troy-04242020-01-27-23)), but was this resolved in any way -- other than by using a Supervisor?

##### Master.L 04/19/2021 07:50:18
Hi.

I would like to implement a force/torque sensor in webots.

In the webots documentation, I found a force sensor that came with a 3-axis force value, but couldn't find a sensor that could get the torque value.

How can I get the torque value?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 04/19/2021 07:53:14
This is currently not implemented. I believe the way to go is to implement a new type of touch sensor that would be called "force-6d" and would return both the force and torque.

##### bobhead 04/19/2021 07:55:10

Thanks for your reply,

I am working on a reinforcement learning project in which I need to reset a humanoid robot position and gesture randomly at the start of each episode. Is there any way to set the joint positions before simulation started?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/19/2021 09:59:53
Usually for reinforcement learning, you use a Supervisor controller to set the world and robot and the Supervisor API has a reset function to prepare the world to the next episode.

Depending on your needs, you can dynamically add the robot from the Supervisor controller so that it is already inserted in the world with the desired pose, or use the Supervisor API to change just the joints position.

Note that the Supervisor API also has options to restart the robot controller in case it is needed after setting it to the desired position.

##### alireza1992 04/19/2021 10:25:47
Thank you;

But "reset" takes a lot of time, I want a faster process like defining fields for position of links and use from "node.getField()", but I have some problem with it

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/19/2021 21:05:55
I think it should work through rosetta 2, like any other x86 program


Webots is a rigid body simulator, internal material stresses and deformations are not calculated. Bodies are rigid and only their kinematics and interaction is simulated.


you can convert / save the data as .ply files. [http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/) this might give you some insight in the format. Not that different from .obj files. What language are you using for your python controller?

Hello Webots community. I have a problem with the control of the UR3 model. Whenever I give it a positive velocity it doesn't allow me to go into a negative angular position. I have changed it by converting it to base notes and removed the "boundingObject Group" how most of the links and joints and I have added touch sensors to them. Maybe that has messed something up? I have tried to mess around with minStop and maxStop of the hinge joint parameters, but nothing seems to help.

Did you try to declare the color and number variables non-local (e.g., remove the `local` keyword)?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/21/2021 06:25:19
`@moris` also, you don't need to create full nodes for all three variants if you plan on using just one, can do something like this

```
Shape {
  appearance PBRAppearance {
    %{ if color == "red" then }%
      baseColor 0 0 0
    %{ elseif color == "blue" then }%
      baseColor 1 1 1
    %{ else }%
      baseColor 0.5 0.5 0.5
    %{ end }%
      transparency 0
      roughness 1 
      ...
  }
  geometry Mesh {
   ...
  }
}
```

Hello guys, does anyone know how to use ikpy in webots? I found a example, but I cannot get all my link follow the example

##### Dorteel 04/21/2021 07:36:56
which robot are you using it with? It worked for us with the UR3

##### Yi Zhou 04/21/2021 07:37:31
franka panda robot

##### Tosidis 04/21/2021 10:36:43
Any updates for supervisor.simulationReset() (python) ? It still crashes webots, even with nightly build

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/21/2021 11:05:45
Did you already provide an example where the crash is reproducible? Are you using Webots R2021a rev 1 or R2021b?

##### Tosidis 04/21/2021 11:48:18
webots\_2021a (stable) and webots\_2021a-rev1, happens in both. I am gonna create a very simple example (i suppose it will do the same) , so its minimal and easy to reproduce

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/21/2021 11:49:35
Yes, having an simple example we will be able to inspect the issue. Because I tested and in my project it is working just fine, the simulation is reset and Webots doesn't crash.

##### Tosidis 04/21/2021 11:49:58
which version?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/21/2021 11:50:33
I tested both on the master (R2021a rev1) and develop (R2021b) branches.

##### Tosidis 04/21/2021 11:51:14
doing it now and i will post the code

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/21/2021 12:01:30
We fixed some issues with the camera recognition functionality recently.

I would suggest you to try the latest nightly build of Webots R2021a rev1 and check if this issue is still reproducible:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_19\_4\_2021](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_19_4_2021)

##### Tosidis 04/21/2021 12:32:48
Working on the mavic2 controller (translated to python)



robot = Supervisor()

root = robot.getRoot()

children = root.getField('children')



while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    if robot.getTime() > 10:

        robot.simulationReset()

        human\_model = 'human.wbo'

        children.importMFNode(-1, human\_model)


if i dont import the node after each reset it works fine, but if I import the object it crashes (after a couple of resets)

version: R2021a rev1

Another thing happening, is that the drone won't get to the initial state after a couple of resets either (2 of the 4 motors stop moving)

##### younes 04/21/2021 12:40:09
hi guys i am using webots2021a and Matlab2018, i am trying to command an epuck2 using webot-matlab , while creating the world in webot , i'm getting this error :


remote control initialisation failed

[matlab] Error: Cannot load the "C:/Webots/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote\_controls/e-puck\_bluetooth/e-puck\_bluetooth.dll" remote control library.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/21/2021 12:51:49
A simple workaround to the crash that works for me is to change the import index for example from `-1` to `2` or any other index value that is valid after reset.

I will inspect why the `-1` is not correctly translated to valid index.

##### moris 04/21/2021 13:11:42

Hello everyone hope all is fine I’m trying to combine a robot with. An robotic hand every part of this robot work prefectly alone but when I merge the 2 robot only the robotic hand work any help know how to solve this problem please

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/22/2021 06:18:22
I would suggest you to start by following this tutorial: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers)


You could use a sensor, for example the Compass, to measure the orientation of the robot or a PositionSensor to measure how much the the motor turned

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass)

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor)

##### JSK 04/22/2021 07:58:41
Hello there. Any one know the working of compas in webots?


i want to know how does the values of -1 to 1 in compas deals with angle?


i mean if the compas value is 0.89 then what is it in degrees? is it a cosine relation?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/22/2021 08:06:27
The Compass device returns the vector direction pointing from the Compass center to the world north.

In the documentation you can find a sample code to compute the bearing angle based on this vector:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass#compass-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass#compass-functions)

##### JSK 04/22/2021 08:35:17

Yes, the documentation is currently down.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/22/2021 11:48:01
`@Dorteel` if you set a position that isn't infinity, it switches from velocity control to position control as described in this table: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#force-and-torque-control](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#force-and-torque-control), the functions have different effects depending on which type of control you are doing

##### AndreiSPb 04/22/2021 14:38:30
Hello! Can someone explain how should I treat 2nd string for moments of inertia in physics of Solid? What Input should I make? I dont really get why the matrix is not 3x3... I can get values of 3x3 matrix from CAD.

##### Maël Wildi [Moderator] 04/22/2021 14:42:34
The first vector is the diagonal [I11, I22, I33] of the matrix and the second one is for [I12, I13, I23] ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics))

##### AndreiSPb 04/22/2021 14:50:25
Well yeah I read that in docs and it seems not absolutely correct. Matrix can be not symmetrical with [I12, I13, I23] not equal to [I21, I31, I32]. Or am I missing something?

##### Maël Wildi [Moderator] 04/22/2021 14:55:13
In the case of matrices of inertia I think they are the same because these terms are the products of inertia with respect to a plane, for instance I12 is for the XY plane = YX plane.

##### AndreiSPb 04/22/2021 19:03:14
Thank you for your answers!

In that case, what coordinate system is used in webots to define this matrix, how does it change during the movements and should I provide any coordinate transform to ensure the correctness of the matrix?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/22/2021 20:18:01
`@AndreiSPb` The inertia matrix is 3x3, but since the lower left corner is symetrical to the upper right corner, it is common to express with the diagonal, plus the upper right corner, which is precisely how it is done in Webots. Hope that helps

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/23/2021 21:36:39
`@Alejandro Pescathore` you gave all rotational motors the same name? If so then yes, only one will move. The possibility of controlling multiple motors at once is being worked on at the moment, but for now you'll have to give each their own unique name, and in the controller get the corresponding `WbDeviceTag` and give the position command to each

are you trying to get the camera from a different robot?

##### dA$H 04/24/2021 19:30:19
yes

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/24/2021 19:30:55
it might be easier to add the camera to those robots, with a transform from the base (which is static I assume)


then you dont have to fiddle with extra controllers


A device is not the same as a node, and a controller only has access to the devices of the robot that started the controller

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/24/2021 19:58:06
of course it does, you forgoe the physics simulation by simply changing the state


if you dont want it to drop, you have to move the box accordingly


use motors and joints to simulate with proper physics


As an ugly fix, you could perhaps try moving in very small increments and a lower timestep, but no guarantee that it works.

Hey everyone, noob question. I'm trying to build a robot from imported mesh geometry and can't figure out how to import a mesh as a bounding obj. When I import the mesh directly (from url) as a bounding object and try to assign physics, I get a warning that "boundingObj"  is  not defined and I can't assign mass or inertia. However, it *seems* to work if I first import the mesh using file -> Import 3D Model then create a DEF for the mesh shape to use in the robot. Is this the way it's supposed to work or am I missing something?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/25/2021 15:20:18
`@gus` [https://www.hmc.edu/lair/ARW/ARW-Lecture01-Odometry.pdf](https://www.hmc.edu/lair/ARW/ARW-Lecture01-Odometry.pdf) slide #23 has the formula


After some algebra, you are left with this formula:

`delta_motor_pos = theta_turn * axle_length / wheel_radius`


theta\_turn would be the turn angle in radians


delta\_motor\_pos is the difference in angle for the left and right wheel.


so you could turn one wheel + delta\_motor\_pos/2 and the other - delta\_motor\_pos/2

##### Sérgio 04/25/2021 19:33:12
Hi

##### main 04/26/2021 02:03:39
When using scaling on a robot, is the mass also scaled with this? e.g if my robot goes from 1 down to 0.5 scale, will my entered mass go from 10kg to 5kg in theory (If 10kg is entered in the physics node) Or will the mass still be 10kg, just the robot will be smaller?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 06:06:38
Which  Device method are you using to load the image into the display?Because from the screenshot it seems that the format is wrong (for example 3 channels instead of 4 channels).

If you are using `wb_display_image_new`, you should make sure that the format that you pass to the Display API corresponds to the format of your image (e.g., RGB, ARGB, BGRA, etc.).

If you are using a Webots version older than R2021a, I would also suggest you to upgrade because we fixed issues with the Display image format.


This is probably a bug. I will inspect this.

However it is not recommended to use complex mesh geometries as boundingObjects because it will very likely cause instabilities in the physics computation. Instead, it is suggested to approximate the mesh using simple geometries (sphere, box, cylinder, capsule).


Yes, after scaling the mass is updated but not linearly as you would expect. When you scale a robot, its bounding objects are scaled as well. If all the Physics nodes of the robot define the density value (and not the mass value), then the actual mass (and resulting inertia matrix) of the robot should be scaled appropriately as well. However, if one of the Physics nodes of the robot defines a mass value explicitly, then, this mass will remain unscaled. For these reasons it is not recommended to scale robots because the physical behavior could no longer correspond to the originally unscaled robot.

##### ChristmasLights 04/26/2021 08:21:26
Hey everyone, is there anyone with the experience of using webots controller to control a web simulation? I have several motion files that I can run on the robot while using desktop application. But not sure about how can i manage to use this controller to control a web simulated robot.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 09:45:02
It depends on which kind of web simulation are you using. If you refer to [Web Simulation]([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation)) described in the User Guide, then a Webots instance and the controller is executed locally on a machine and the simulation updates are sent to the client browser.

##### ChristmasLights 04/26/2021 09:46:51
Yes, this is the one I am referring to. I am trying to use an external controller (written in Python) to run some motion files on a web simulation.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 09:48:39
Once you start the Webots instance, and given that it is external, the controller, then the simulation should be streamed automatically. Note that in any case the controller is run locally on your machine/server and not on the web.

##### ChristmasLights 04/26/2021 09:51:50
Should I make any changes to my controller that works locally? I've followed this link for the local one: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming)

##### tabousoud 04/26/2021 09:52:19
Thank you for the follow up and advice!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 09:54:19
No because the controller will in any case run locally.


`@ChristmasLights` I think that it is not clear what you want to achieve. Do you want to stream your simulation + controller on the web or do you want to modify the controller from the web simulation?

##### ChristmasLights 04/26/2021 09:59:26
I want to use an external controller on a web simulation (no need to modify it), have backend written in django. What I'm trying to achieve is, trigger some motion files depending on the state (assuming there are multiple states with multiple motion files are attached to). Like if situation 1 happens, my external controller should run the specific motion file on the simulation.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 10:01:47
Ok, so I don't see where is the issue. Once you can run it locally, it can also be streamed on the web.

##### ChristmasLights 04/26/2021 10:39:41
When I try to run the local controller, it gives the following error: Webots doesn't seems to be ready yet: (retrying in 1 second). But its up and running and i can see the robot on localhost.

##### Yi Zhou 04/26/2021 10:43:52
Hello guys, I try to use getRangeImage to get the depth image of kinect, but the value is None, kinect works but no image data get, do anyone know the reason?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 11:08:49
The external controller should run on the same computer as the Webots instance. Here are the instructions to use external controllers:

##### yash 04/26/2021 13:22:47
Hello ! Is the robot translation field updated at every time step .?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 13:24:43
`@yash` Hi, if it changes yes.

##### yash 04/26/2021 13:26:15
Okay , thanks 👍


The time step at which the loop -

while robot.step(timestep)!=-1 is updated is as per the basic time step specified in the world info right .?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 13:41:14
`@yash` don't know if I understand your question right, but the value you provide as argument (`timestep`) is the duration in milliseconds that will be simulated before the function is called again. Which ideally should be a multiple of `basicTimeStep` in worldInfo. So you can simulate the world very accurately, but sense/control at lower frequency.

##### yash 04/26/2021 13:52:35

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 14:52:17
Did you enable the "kinect range" device of the Kinect PROTO node?

You can find here a sample C controller using the Kinect range image. The workflow is the same in each programming languages:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pioneer-3dx#pioneer3dx\_with\_kinect-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/pioneer-3dx#pioneer3dx_with_kinect-wbt)

##### Yi Zhou 04/26/2021 14:53:17
Yes, I enable the camera

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 14:53:56
It is not enough to enable the camera device `kinect color`. You also have to enable the range finder device `kinect range`.

##### Yi Zhou 04/26/2021 14:55:26
Sure, I enable this, I can see image from webots, but I cannot get it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 14:56:20
What code do you use to get the range finder data?


And the range finder device

##### Yi Zhou 04/26/2021 14:58:49
img\_array = self.kinect\_range.getRangeImage()    self.kinect\_range = self.getDevice("kinect range")

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/26/2021 15:02:25
Here is a sample Python controller that works just fine in printing the Kinect range finder image:

```
from controller import Robot

robot = Robot()
timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())
kinect_range = robot.getDevice("kinect range")
kinect_range.enable(timestep)

while robot.step(timestep) != -1:
    print(kinect_range.getRangeImage())
```

##### Yi Zhou 04/26/2021 15:03:55
Thanks. I'll try😀

##### Deleted User 04/26/2021 17:06:15
Hi there! I'm a student from New Rochelle High School in the Advanced Robotics class. While using WeBots we ran into several glitches which left me and my classmates stumped. Such examples are as followed: The robot itself glitching through the floor, the robot flinging itself while holding the ring, some portion of the robot being left behind while moving up or down on the Z-axis, and the robot falling through the floor even though physics are enabled. Some of these issues were resolved after shutting down and reopening WeBots but later persisted. If you have a fix to these problems please let me know.


Heres a picture of the part remaining afloat yet when we move it it will move back to its original positioning

##### ChristmasLights 04/26/2021 20:39:25
For now, I am running the web server locally (on the same computer with the controller), but still getting the mentioned error. When I use the controller with the desktop app, there is no problem. I am using the web simulation with the docker, settings are mentioned as in the link. Maybe there is something I am missing with external controller. Is there any setting that I should change in the dockerfile in order to use my external controller on the web simulation? As long as I know, the webots is using the default nao controller instead of the external.

Hi, the camera can be enabled, but both color image and depth image cannot show, is it possible because of the kinect camera?

##### Johan2021 04/27/2021 09:18:45
Hi all, I would have to detect a collision/distance threshold between a dynamic body and any other body in the world, and subsequently align these 2 bodies - very much like the connector snap functionality (which I would not be using). For the collision I would implement an IR sensor. However, I am not sure how to align these 2 bodies/retrieve their orientation - since it is not known a priori which body the other body should align with. Would anyone know more about this?

##### tabousoud 04/27/2021 10:12:43
Hi all, is there a way to construct other simple shapes in Webots beyond the basic primitives? For example, truncated cones (drafted cylinder) or prism-type shapes? Thanks!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/27/2021 10:25:18
`@tabousoud` Hi, not directly but you can create them with other software and import them: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/mesh](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/mesh)

##### tabousoud 04/27/2021 10:33:21
`@DDaniel` Hi Daniel, thanks for the feedback. I want to use these shapes for bounding object geometry and it seems that the recommendation is to avoid imported mesh geometry for that, so I was trying to use standard shapes in Webots. Does that same caveat also apply for simple meshes?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/27/2021 10:44:59
Yes, generally it is suggested to avoid very complex shapes (typically, using the mesh of the piece itself, with potentially hundreds or thousands of faces is overkill) for boundingObjects as it makes the collision detection computationally very intensive and at times also less reliable, but if none of the basic shapes (or a combination of them) fits the bill for your application you can still use something else. As for the primitive shapes, keep in mind you can group more of them together

##### tabousoud 04/27/2021 10:46:41
`@DDaniel` Got it, many thanks!

##### Dorteel 04/27/2021 12:16:40
Thanks! I managed to get it work, but it's a pretty ugly solution:



`       cameraData = camera.getImage()

        image = ... bunch of processing with openCV

        # Displaying the camera image directly

        #ir = display\_score.imageNew(cameraData, Display.BGRA, camera.getWidth(), camera.getHeight())

        # Displaying the processed image

        cv2.imwrite('tmp.jpg', image)

        ir = display\_score.imageLoad('tmp.jpg')

        display\_score.imagePaste(ir, 0, 0, False)

        display\_score.imageDelete(ir)`



The commented line displays the right image directly from the camera, but I couldn't get to display the processed image with the `imageNew` function

You can always use the generic Lidar node:

and parameterize it so it has the same characteristics as your Lidar.

##### James Le Poidevin 04/27/2021 13:41:49
Hello, I saw on a ROS forum that webots is debating using URDF files instead of proto files ([https://discourse.ros.org/t/urdf-with-webots/19665](https://discourse.ros.org/t/urdf-with-webots/19665)).  Do you have any idea how you are going to proceed for indexedFaces seeing that webots doesn't not keep a reference of the original mesh file(stl,dae ...)  once imported. I ask the question because i'm currently try to convert a robot containing mainly meshs and i would like to create a urdf for this robot.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/27/2021 13:43:04
In Webots, you can include meshes or reference them. See the Mesh node:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/mesh](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/mesh)

##### James Le Poidevin 04/27/2021 13:46:57
OK thank you.


But they still are exported in the urdf even as a mesh ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 04/27/2021 14:26:25
The URDF export is limited, it replaces visual meshes by bounding objects:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_urdf](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_urdf) (check the note)



Regarding the Discourse post, we concluded that we want to allow URDF importation (the other way around).

##### James Le Poidevin 04/27/2021 14:27:45
Ok I see, Thank you.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 19:56:44
`@James Le Poidevin` I've written a tool that extracts the meshes from proto files. So using the webots -> urdf export, and a bit of manual adjusting, you can get a full urdf file with all visual meshes included

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:10:39
Do Webots have a native delay function on the controller with C?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 20:11:51
You can use a normal C delay function?!


Webots controllers only continue the simulation when you explicitly call the robot step function

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:13:00
We are using this


void delay(int time, int atual)

{

    while (wb\_robot\_step(TIME\_STEP) != -1) {

      if (wb\_robot\_get\_time() > time + atual){

        break;

       }

  }

}


Is there an error?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 20:13:40
what do you want to achieve?

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:15:10
My robot needs make a reverse curve when the infra sensor detects the line

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 20:16:19
so you want a function that simply executes the current commands for a certain amount of time?

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:16:52
exactly


Now we are calling a function that curves and interrupts the code using delay

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 20:18:03
if (wb\_robot\_get\_time() < t\_simulate){

        continue;


you could put that at the start of your loop


and when you want the main loop to skip any logic, you set the t\_simulate to the current sim time + the duration


as soon as wb\_robot\_get\_time() is bigger than that t\_sim, it will execute the rest of your loop


also, time is double, not int

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:21:53
Ok, but i need use this logic of delay more times in the code that's why I create the function above

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 20:22:20
void delay(double duration)

{

    double time\_end = wb\_robot\_get\_time() + duration;

    while (wb\_robot\_step(TIME\_STEP) != -1) {

      if (wb\_robot\_get\_time() > time\_end ){

        break;

       }

  }

}

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:22:29
You think that will works?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/27/2021 20:22:33
not a c programmer, but perhaps like this?

##### Affonso 04/27/2021 20:22:45
yeah

Hi, I'm writing a script to run and record the simulation. My controller add several PROTOs into my world during simulator running and the cursor will highlight the added object. So in my video, the object's coordinate (three axes with RGB) will be recorded. How can I avoid this?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/29/2021 09:33:58
One option is to hide the handles to move the object (the three axes with RGB and arrows) from the "View" > "Scene Interactions" > "Disable Object Move". Note that handles are only disabled if the node is selected from the 3D scene and not from the scene tree.

##### jasonc1025 04/29/2021 11:41:06
Thx `@Stefania Pedrazzi`  for helping me with my attempted "Web Simulation: Quick Start: 'Simulation starting' " frozen status.   (I've move my question-thread over to Webots, to be topic-consistent.)  ; )  Unfortunately, I'm not that good w/ PHP for Website Hosting.  



Just curious re: my 'Quick Start: Simulation starting...' frozen status, how important do my ports need to be opened? (1999 and 2000 are opened, yet my Comcast-xFinity is having issues opening 443, 2001+ as I read somewhere as being needed.) Btw, Is there a 'LocalHost' approach to see if it can work w/in my own LAN?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 04/29/2021 11:51:23
Ports 1999, 2000 are used by the web simulation server, ports 2001+ are used by the Webots instances. So you have to make sure that at least ports to 1999 to 2005 are open. Note that this range of port is configurable as described in documentation.

Port 443 is required to use HTTPS so it will probably be open by default.


All what is described in the documentation runs on localhost.

If you want to access from another computer in the same network, then you should use the IP address.

`@Olivier Michel` and related Colleagues, as program manager... my supervisors have been very impressed with Webots and we would be honored to be annual subscribers if we can get Web Simulation working, as we're looking for an open-source Robotics Sim platform to develop EdTech curriculum with our partner NASA ISS.  Yet our server experience is more node.js and python (flask-based), vs. PHP & Java.  We're based in Silicon Valley, CA USA ([https://questforspace.com/](https://questforspace.com/)), so feel free to verify us as needed.  ; )


`@Olivier Michel` , `@Stefania Pedrazzi`, et al,  re: Web Simulation, due to our limited server skill-sets, e.g. running Docker would be cool, yet we need just simple copy & paste lines to 'mindlessly' create and run the Docker image.  Hope this makes sense.  ; )

##### Venkat 04/29/2021 15:43:40
`@Darko Lukić` Thank you. I was able to do so. With a 270 degree scanning angle for the lidar, I am able to visualize the "Lidar Ray Path" exactly the way being defined. But I am unable to see the "Lidar Point cloud" as expected. The point cloud visualization displays light around few areas, but not for the whole area (270 degrees). I tried slowing the simulation by reducing the basicTimeStep, but still the display remains the same.

Hello everyone, I have recently implemented radars in my webots world. I noticed however that I do not get multiple detections for a large building, instead I just get one single hit. I have used radars quite a bit in the real world and the simulated data was not quite what I expected.


Is there anything I can do about this?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 04/29/2021 21:45:27
`@havilesa` By doing this 

```
joints[i].setPosition(float('inf'))
joints[i].setVelocity(0.0)
```

you're setting the motors for Velocity control, but afterwards with this `joints[front_left_arm].setPosition(-0.227)` you're switching them to Position control and in Position control what you provided using the setVelocity (0) specifies the maximal velocity, so they won't move. Take a look at this table [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-control-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-control-summary)

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:10:34
Hi there, I have a question I couldn't an answer anywhere still: Does webots support machining simulation, like milling or cutting by a robotic end effector?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 01:12:37
`@Darth Jon` No, Solids are "indestructible". You could probably find a complicated way to make it work, but it does not support such a feature.

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:13:00
Tyvm Simon!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 01:13:24

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:14:35
I'm deciding which platform I'm going to use in my PhD, I'm comparing the features and limitations of each

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 01:15:03
What are your requirements? What exactly do you want to simulate?

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:17:06
I'll develop the digital twin of an automation laboratory of university and develop a CPS on top of it and simulating all the factory processes may be interesting from a research point of view


I'm in the preliminary stages so may need it or not


not sure still


but once I start, there's no way back kinda


wont migrate all work after months of development

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 01:19:12
You wont find a robotic simulator who can actually simulate machining.


like FEM and CFM can't be done properly in real time in a rigid body physics engine


The robot simulators such as Gazebo, Webots, PyBullet, Mujoco etc. are rigid body simulators


you can simulate all the movement, but not the actual cutting process

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:25:10
It probably doesn't use FEM but I found one that allows mesh manipulation in real time, so the robots can simulate cut and milling but it has another limitations like very small robot library

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 01:25:23
which one?

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:26:02
Coppeliasim (new name for V-REP)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 01:26:54
it's proprietary. I'd stick with open source and free if I were you


also has lots of other drawbacks

##### Darth Jon 04/30/2021 01:28:03
yeah, it can be used for PhD cause it has an educational free license but yeah it has weakness too that's why I'm studying the case

Hey everyone. I would appreciate some assistance. I'm working with the built-in "iRobot's Create" world but I've run into an issue. 



Within the controller for the robot (create\_avoid\_obstacles.c), a turn() function is specified that takes an angle in Radians as input. 



I've messed around with the function, giving it specific instead of random values, like 90 ° (M\_PI / 2) but I notice that it's extremely inaccurate and imprecise.



For example, if I give 180°, it only turns by about 140°. If I give 90°, it only turns by about 60. Can anyone help me with this?

Hi guys, I am working on a robot attached with 2 solid frames getting rotated independently. outer frame will rotate along one axis and the inner frame is connected to outer with a motor and rotates in another axis. so the inner has to rotate along its own axis with outer frame. I have anchored the frames same as the endpoint translation. outer is working fine but inner frame is not rotating properly. Inner frame's anchoring is not working properly and its anchor position is changing while rotation.  Can anyone help me to solve this issue?

There is no adahesion. You can increase the friction by a lot, so they wont move, but it will still require some force to press the two objects together. If you want them to be actually stuck together, you either have to link them with a transform node, or use connector nodes

##### Nick R 04/30/2021 22:23:30
Can anyone explain why the Velodyne HDL-32 sensors don't have concentric rings where they hit the floor, but star-like patterns - is this intentional? The VLP-16 (superimposed in white) has circular rings as I would expect. [https://imgur.com/a/zcl5RCT](https://imgur.com/a/zcl5RCT)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 22:23:40
Your problem is hard to visualize. Can you share a screenshot or quick video?


It seems like it has 6 sensors aranged in a circle pointing outward


if you overlay their waves, that would result in the pattern you see


hmm no, that does not seem to be it

##### Nick R 04/30/2021 22:29:39
Based on real data ([https://velodynelidar.com/products/hdl-32e/](https://velodynelidar.com/products/hdl-32e/)) something looks quite off

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 22:29:47
ahh, it is rotating. Try lowering the timestep and see if the pattern changes

##### Nick R 04/30/2021 22:31:24
Thanks, still confused about how to lower the timestep. As with my tests before, this is running as an external controller... launched with the ROS2 interface

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 22:31:40
in world info, you set the timestep lower


looking at the HDL-32 proto file, you can see the properties:

`tiltAngle -0.19896287

  horizontalResolution 4500  # 360 / 0.08

  fieldOfView 1.570795       # 6.28318 / 4

  verticalFieldOfView 0.468

  numberOfLayers 64

  minRange 0.8

  maxRange 120

  spherical TRUE

  type "rotating"

  noise 0.000167 # 0.02 / 120

  defaultFrequency 5

  minFrequency 5

  maxFrequency 15`


so it rotates with 5 hz


at 32ms timestep, your simulation runs at about 30 hz


so one rotation only has about 6 positions that get simulated


hence the star pattern


Does that make sense?

##### Nick R 04/30/2021 22:34:19
Yes it does, thank you 🙂 If I set the WorldInfo timestep lower then they approach circular rings. But of course the RTF takes a hit

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 22:34:23
If you were to lower the timestep to 16ms, one rotation of the lidar would have 12 positions and so on


yes, that is the issue


you could fake it and make a surround lidar with 360° FOV

##### Nick R 04/30/2021 22:41:40
Does this amount to using the basic Lidar and setting type to "fixed" ? Any way to override the rotation of the HDL-32 or I have to go back to using the basic LIDAR if I want to achieve this?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 04/30/2021 22:42:50
A basic lidar I assume. You can also duplicate the proto file and adjust it


changed it to fixed and 360°


try this

the file name and the proto name (line:8 in the file) have to be identical, otherwise Webots does not open it

I have a robot like in the video and when it moves it will recognize the objects it has passed and read the color of that object. However, as you can see in the camera image, the colors of these objects will be read again and again. So is there a way for me to get the camera to only recognize each object once and which object has already read its color then won't read it again? Thank you so much!

Hello everyone, I'm trying to model a gripper similar to this one in the pic and can't figure out how to use `SolidReference` to close the loop. 



Using the right  linkage as an example, I first attempted:

body -> joint j1 -> endpoint L1 -> j2 -> L2 -> ... -> j5 -> endpoint = SolidReference(body)

but this didn't seem to work. 

I tried a different approach with L3 as the SolidReference node closing the inner (L4) and outer links (L1, L2)  where L3 is an endpoint for j3 and a SolidReference endpoint for j4.



Can someone please advise the way to define this linkage? Thanks!

Did you check in the logs (default path: `$WEBOTS_HOME/resources/web/server/log/simulation/` and `$WEBOTS_HOME/resources/web/server/log/session/`) if other errors are printed?

If not, I would suggest you to debug the `simulation_server.py` script and in particular the `setup_project` function to better understand why the project files are not copied.

##### Yannnick3 [Cyberbotics] 05/03/2021 19:33:55
Hello everyone ! I'm implementing a VIO module in Webots using ROS. The module has a camera, an accelerometer and a gyroscope. I enable them using the corresponding ROS services. Once activated, each sensor publishes its values on its topic (example: /Module/camera/image for the camera). My problem is the following: I can enable them with any sampling period, the different sensors always publish their value on the topics with a period corresponding to the basicTimeStep of the Webots world. For example, for my camera to publish images at a frequency of 40hz, I enable it with a period of 25ms. Despite this, the camera topic receives an image every 5ms, which is the period of my Webots world. Is there a way to obtain the correct publishing frequency on the topics? Thanks in advance ! 🙂

##### Gustavo Cruz 05/03/2021 20:06:13
I checked the simulation server logs and found that the problem was with the setup\_project\_from\_github function.

The function was checking for the presence of the word "tag" or "branch" in the project link on github, but it was not checking the word "blob".

Thanks for helping me.

Unfortunately, even correcting the problem, the simulation is not yet started and the client keeps displaying the message "Starting simulation ...".



No error is shown and this is the siling server log at the moment:

Hello, I have a problem, I created a test 6-wheeled robot, and wanted to check if the engines are powerful enough for different types of terrains, I've added contact properties and changed Coulomb friction for all of the different surfaces, but the speed of the robots on each of the surface is same, what did i do wrong? 😦

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/04/2021 01:37:13
`@Boichu` That means that there is most likely no slippage. Set the friction to 0 for one of them as a sanity check


wait.. I think I misunderstood your question. Why would they move at different speeds in your opinion?

##### Boichu 05/04/2021 01:48:44
Shouldn't there be some resistance to motion on different friction surfaces? I might be wrong though please don't judge too hard.

I did check on 0, no movement, so it's fine

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/04/2021 01:49:33
You have wheels, as long as they dont slip, there is almost no resistance


You would be right if you were to drag a block across those surfaces, but you are rolling them


There is rolling friction, but i'm not sure it is simulated here, and it very small compared to other sources of friction or drag


Just think of rolling a rubber toy wheel across sandpaper. Rolls without any issues right? Now try to drag it across without spinning. Almost impossible

##### Boichu 05/04/2021 02:02:59
I guess you are right, was thinking about slipping like car on ice, or slowing down on sand, but i'm not sure if it should appear here, thank you for your help

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/04/2021 02:05:47
the slipping on ice can be simulated. Sand is more tricky, as it is not a solid surface

##### Boichu 05/04/2021 02:09:59

The period should be a multiple of the basic timestep:

##### Yannnick3 [Cyberbotics] 05/04/2021 08:11:59
Thanks for your answer. In my case the sampling period is 25ms, while the basic timestep is 5ms. But the sensors still sample values every 5ms (topic frequency is 200hz instead of 40hz). The get\_sampling\_time service returns the correct sampling period though. Am I missing something here ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/04/2021 08:19:39
It seems we are not increasing the `mStep` here:

Yes that's the source of the problem ! I added the mStep incrementation. I also needed to replace mStepSize by mRobot->getBasicTimeStep() in the following line, because mStepSize is always equal to 1 and not to the actual duration of a step: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/73fe51ccc30a82fede130c67a8d983eec96589a1/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L483](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/73fe51ccc30a82fede130c67a8d983eec96589a1/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L483)

I assume you are on a retina display, right? Then, setting an environment variable like `QT_ENABLE_HIGHDPI_SCALING=1` should help. See [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2631](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2631). Otherwise, you may try to edit `WEBOTS_HOME/resources/stylesheet.*.qss` with a text editor and see whether you can change icon sizes in there.

##### tabousoud 05/05/2021 13:03:09
Hello everyone! I'm trying to figure out how to implement a robot extension slot within a PROTO. 



From what I've seen looking at the existing protos and some of the examples, the way to do this is to add the `MFFloat` field instantiated with an empty array and reference this at the associated node (e.g. endpoint -> solid -> transform -> `children IS extensionSlot`).  I modeled a manipulator and gripper, and used this approach to specify an expansion slot on the manipulator robot. The associated protos for both are in the same project directory and all devices (motors, sensors, etc.) on the robot and gripper have unique names. When using the models, I can add the gripper to the slot as expected. However, I get a "device not found" error when running the controller and referencing a device from the gripper (e.g. `robot.getDevice("left_finger_actuator")`). 



This doesn't seem to be an issue when working with existing robots and devices in Webots. My guess is I need to add a path to the child proto but have no clue where/how to do this. Any pointers? Thanks!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/05/2021 13:12:38
The name of your motor (inside the PROTO) is `left_finger_actuator`?

##### tabousoud 05/05/2021 13:15:08
Yes, that is the name in the PROTO (in this example, at least).

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/05/2021 13:19:40
If you `(Right click on the PROTO) > Convert to Base Node` you should be able to see a generated robot structure inside the scene tree. Try to run `robot.getDevice("left_finger_actuator")` then. If that fails, try to find the `left_finger_actuator` node in the scene tree.

##### tabousoud 05/05/2021 13:23:27
Cool, I'll give that a shot. Just to clarify: Is it the child (i.e. gripper) PROTO that I should convert?

##### Gustavo Cruz 05/05/2021 13:40:41
I executed the instruction on a terminal. The Webots program started but then closed quickly. And then a message appeared at the terminal. I think the problem is because he is trying to open the file that is in the path '/tmp/webots/instances/140192500708640/worlds/empty.wbt' but the right path is' / tmp / webots / instances / 140192500708640 / WebotsWorld / worlds /empty.wbt '

##### tabousoud 05/05/2021 14:26:11
`@Darko Lukić` Thanks, I have it working now. The problem is that I tried to convert the Robot node I made for the gripper into a Solid node by manually editing its PROTO and removing some fields. I noticed when using `Convert to Base Node` that it still shows up as a `Robot` node. I reversed the process by converting the Robot node into a solid (from the scene tree) first and then adding back the actuators - which get lost when converting Robot to Solid - manually in the PROTO. This fixed the issue.

any solution ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/05/2021 22:24:15
`@Mohannad Kassar` As the error says, the file has Separator nodes, which do not exist in Webots.


`@main` It is the maximum torque the motor can utilize. It is not dependent on rotational speed

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/06/2021 06:04:55
About the browser, if you start the simulation manually then, you should pay attention because on the browser the use simulation server port may not match.

But if the simulation starts from a terminal then it should also start directly from the script (if you are using the exact same instructions). You should debug what is the difference and why the simulation server doesn't work.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/06/2021 10:47:14
Note that each `Robot` node is an independent system with each own robot controller and can only access its own devices. So you cannot access devices from a descendant robot from the parent robot controller.

in practice, if the `Robotiq2f` PROTO is of type `Robot`, then you should add a dedicated controller in the `Robotiq2f.controller` field to control its devices.

Alternatively, you should replace the `Robot` node with a `Solid` node in the `Robotiq2f` PROTO definition

Note that the "open" message is only sent if Webots is started with the streaming `monitorActivity` option.


The original `simulation_server.py` code already enables this option by default.

Hi. I am using webots 2021 and I'm trying to get the color of a color patch on ground using webots camera node. I program with C++.

I came across 2 problems. 

1. When I reload the world and simulate for the first time, it take some time for the camera to start capturing (about 2 seconds) and by that time the color patch is already passed. But when I reset the world (without reloading) and simulate again, camera start capturing right from the beginning (just the way I want it to). 

How can I solve this issue?

2. When the camera gets disabled through code after serving it's purpose, the camera keep disabled even in next simulations (even after I reload the world the camera is still disabled). Why?

It is possible, but sounds very complicated. You would need some form of computervision algorithms recognizing and translating the video input into movement commands. That is not included in Webots


Dont use the supervisor for controlling a robot. It "cheats" or "teleports", which screws up the physics. You should only control your robot with motor commands


A custom arm or an existing one? For existing ones you can convert urdf into Webot's proto format


otherwise I suggest you add an existing arm to your webots world, right-click > convert to base nodes


then take a look at the structure and create your own arm accordingly

Hello Everyone!,  I am working on a project for my university on ROS and Webots, I am trying to control two epuck in the same Webots environment with ROS but I am not able to make them work, as if I can do it with only one epuck. I would like to know if anyone has tried to do this and if you could help me thanks.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/09/2021 20:39:26
`@mmoralesp` you need one controller per robot, but they can be "dumb" controllers, simply subscribing and publishing topics. All your logic can be done from the same script / node


The name of the proto file and the name of the proto node inside the file have to be exactly the same.  Post the file and I can take a look

##### SeanLuTW 05/10/2021 00:54:51
If I named the file which doesn't match with the name of the PROTO node, the console will show `'FILE_TO_PROTO': error: PROTO identifier does not match filename`. But if I fixed it, it still not shown.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/10/2021 00:55:15
post the file here, i'll take a look


it is in the protos folder of your project?

##### SeanLuTW 05/10/2021 00:55:38
Here's my PROTO
> **Attachment**: [Kinect.proto](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/841116239266971689/Kinect.proto)


Yes, I put them into the protos subdirectory

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/10/2021 01:04:37
not showing up for me either, i'm investigating


`@SeanLuTW` figured it out. It only shows up when you add it as a child node of a robot


or a handslot etc of a robot


only if "devices" show up under Webots Projects, can your device show up as well

It contains sensors, any device needs a robot as a parent

##### SeanLuTW 05/10/2021 01:13:25
Yes, it show up when I add it as a child of a robot


Thanks! I forgot it is a `Solid` instead of a `Robot`

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/10/2021 01:15:03
if you want to simply place a kinect "in the room" you have to add a base Robot node and add it as a child


it does not need any other solids or shapes

##### Luiz Felipe 05/10/2021 09:38:39
Hello, is it possible to stream a simulation to the browser in 'run' mode? (Running as fast as possible but also able to see the graphics) It seems I can only run in real time or fast mode without graphics during training.

##### h.sciascia 05/10/2021 09:54:17
Hello everyone, 

Is that possible to do a check collision with a Physics Plugin if the robot and environment are not moving ?


I can only detect collision when colliding, not when my robot and environment are already in collision

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/10/2021 10:50:25
Which version of Webots are you using? Are you using X3D or MJPEG streaming?

I just checked and the run mode with the X3D streaming works correctly on Webots R2021a after enabling the `webots.showRun = true;` option in the streaming viewer.

##### Luiz Felipe 05/10/2021 10:52:01
Oh... I am testing with Webots 2020b and MJPEG mode `@Stefania Pedrazzi`... Does it work only with the R2021a and X3D mode?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/10/2021 10:54:12
It works on R2020b too, but with the MJPEG mode you need to enable the graphics rendering in Webots.

If you disabled them in Webots, then the MJPEG streaming cannot work.


To speed up the physics computations, objects are "disabled" if they do not move or don't have new collisions. These "idle" objects are represented in Webots by changing the color of the bounding object from white to blue.

One thing you could try in your physics plugin is to check if the body is enabled using the function `bool dBodyIsEnabled(dBodyID)` and if not try to enabled it manually using  `void dBodeEnable(dBodyID)` and check again if you can detect the collisions.

You can find additional information in the ODE physics engine manual:

[http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Collision\_handling](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Collision_handling)

##### Luiz Felipe 05/10/2021 11:07:00
Locally I can run the three modes (real-time, run, and fast) in 2020b. Yups... it seems the 3 types are supported by the webots class... when I run the 'real-time' mode with MJPEG it works fine with graphics in the stream... If I run the 'run' or 'fast' mode the simulation run as fast as possible but both of them without graphics in the stream...


If i get the graphics in 'real-time' it means the graphics rendering in Webots is enabled right?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/10/2021 11:09:16
Yes. The MJPEG won't work when running with the FAST mode, but should work running the simulation in RUN mode.

If it doesn't, then I would suggest you to upgrade to the latest Webots R2021a.

##### Luiz Felipe 05/10/2021 11:10:30
Okkz! I will test again... because the websocket call changes to R2021a right?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/10/2021 11:16:00
In R2021a, the "run" and "fast" mode have been changed in Webots: only the "fast" remains and the graphics rendering has been added as separate option. In the streaming communication nothing changed.

The main reason to upgrade is that we won't be able to fix bugs, if any, in the old Webots R2020b release.

##### Luiz Felipe 05/10/2021 11:19:42
ok!

##### h.sciascia 05/10/2021 11:33:17

Hello everyone, 

I am doing a simulation with a personalized physics plugin.



My code is generating a lot of random configuration of a 6 dof arm robot and realize them. 

For each configuration I setPosition to the motors, and then erase the previous configuration with a new random one. 



But my simulation is freezing about 5-6 secs after i launch the process.



Have you any idea for the resolution of my problem ? 

Because even if I reset the physics plugin and erase all of the components of my environment to only keep the robot arm the simulation freeze...



Thanks in advance 😉

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/11/2021 06:45:15
The Physics plugin is usually a critical part, you may have a blocking code there. Is it possible for you to test without the plugin?

##### yash 05/11/2021 14:20:55

##### harrymcc 05/11/2021 15:00:22
wb\_motor\_set\_position(left\_motor, 1);

 wb\_motor\_set\_position(right\_motor, 1); i have been going through the tutorials and this code according to it makes the robot come to a stop after 1 rotation of the wheel but it just keep going. Any clue why it does this. Even tried a straight copy and paste of the tutorial code and still nothing

##### Majanao 05/11/2021 16:58:15
Hi, is someone able to use the Blender import function. I always get the same error even with different Blender models.... WARNING: Invalid data, please verify mesh file (bone weights, normals, ...): BLEND: Expected at least one object with no parent

##### KajalGada 05/12/2021 00:08:25
From my understanding, any set position or set velocity command once given will continue to be in that state and not a one off.



If you want it stop after a rotation, you can add an if condition to check current position of wheel and once reached to 1, stop it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/12/2021 02:02:36
`@harrymcc` `@KajalGada` wb\_motor\_set\_position(right\_motor, 1) gives the motor the command to reach the position 1. Once it reaches that position, it stops and holds it. The value is in radian (2*pi = 6.28...) is one rotation. So if your current motor position is 0 and you turn to 1, the robot will only roll a bit. However, if your current position is -100, it will roll quite a bit.


`@Majanao` what type of file did you try to import? Perhaps try to export it as an .obj file and import that


It sounds like you want to export a scene or special structure.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/12/2021 08:15:16
Hello `@cahyadiryan30`, I had remove your post as it contained images that make hard for users to debug your simulation.

Hello, i am trying to use a camera in Webots for the detection of apriltags in ros2 foxy. I tried with the 'Webcam for Robotino3' and the custom camera, but the /camera\_info topic in ros2 is empty, there is only one message at start. 

 Do i have to fill the camera\_info msgs myself or do i miss something?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/12/2021 16:18:27
Hello, the CameraInfo topic is latched, so you should verify QoS of your subscriber

##### Max\_K 05/12/2021 16:29:01
Okay, so its not possible to echo the camera\_info via cmd without QoS settings? I also do not see the image in rviz2 when subscribing to the /image\_raw, are the QoS setting also reason for that?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/12/2021 16:49:27
You can use echo, but:

For image in RViz2 yes, it may be the reason, but you can change QoS in RViz2.

radians. They are motors, so it's angles in radians

##### pewpewpew 05/13/2021 04:37:47
it says that these sensors "allow the robot to know the distance traveled so far",  how would I convert two meters to radians?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/13/2021 08:40:52
For a full rotation of the motor (2pi radians)  the robot will advance roughly by a distance equal to the circumference of the wheel

##### pewpewpew 05/13/2021 08:57:19
thanks! I eventually figured that out, now I'm just trying to get the robot to follow the square path correctly

##### bingdong 05/13/2021 09:12:10
Hi, not sure how the motor.setPosition() function works. I initialised the rotational motor in scene tree and python script, then called motor.setPosition(PositionValue) in the main loop. From what I understand, the controller should calculate velocity according to set PID values to reach position. But the motor doesn't seem to be rotating.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/13/2021 09:15:09
`@bingdong` did you set motor.setVelocity(0) somewhere by any chance? In position control this command specifies the maximal velocity, if you did it won't move.

##### bingdong 05/13/2021 09:17:10
Ah okay. Thought it would change the setVelocity() value while running. Got it, thanks!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/13/2021 09:18:53
`@bingdong` no, only in velocity control it would do that, in position control it specifies the maximal velocity. Keep in mind that the motor API functions have different meanings depending on which type of control you're making (position control, velocity control, torque control). It's summarised in this table: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-control-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-control-summary)

`@mmoralesp` just select the ros controller for each robot. It should automatically create topics and action servers / services to control the robot

Hi everybody, I have a problem with using the `Pen`. it works perfectly on a floor with a single texture tile, but stop working as soon as there are more texture tiles. To reproduce the issue:



1. open `projects/samples/devices/worlds/pen.wbt`

2. start => pen works

3. change `RectangleArena->floorSize->x = 2` 

4. start => pen is double

5. change `RectangleArena->floorSize->y = 2`

4. start => pen doesn't work



`@DDaniel` I adjusted the test scenario: you have to change the `floorSize` to make sure there are several tiles. As long as there is only one tile everything works fine, but there seems to be a problem as soon as the floor consists of several tiles. Alternatively you can set `floorTileSize->x=0.5`, `floorTileSize->y=0.5`

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/16/2021 10:54:26
`@[BU] Heinrich Mellmann` I can't reproduce the bug on 2021a, what version are you using?


`@D26798` As explained here [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/differentialwheels#differentialwheels](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/differentialwheels#differentialwheels), you can replace the differential wheel with a hingejoint + rotational motor + position sensor. You need to use Motor API [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor) and Position Sensor API [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor) to interact with them


`@dA$H` Hi, haven't checked but depending on what you need to do there might be better ways to do it. If you want to control a robot using the keyboard you can use the Keyboard API [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard), which is available by default for Robot nodes (useful for 1 stroke inputs typically, like steering). If you have multiple robots that all have the same controller but want them to behave differently you can do using using controller arguments [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#using-controller-arguments](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#using-controller-arguments). Lastly, you can use a supervisor to send out unique commands to each robot using emitters/receivers.

##### [BU] Heinrich Mellmann 05/16/2021 11:34:28
Thanks for the fast reply! I'm using the same version. You are right, I mistyped a variable name in my test case: for the bug to appear you have to change `floorSize` to make sure your floor texture has more than one tile. I also adjusted the test case description above.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/16/2021 12:16:54
`@[BU] Heinrich Mellmann` I see, I can reproduce it as well. It's due to the fact that the `RectangleArena` PROTO doesn't handle the mapping by itself when changes occur, so when you change the `floorSize` you also need to change the `floorTileSize` accordingly as reported here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1529#issuecomment-615062207](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1529#issuecomment-615062207), but I do agree that it can be misleading

##### D26798 05/16/2021 12:23:29
I have used the position sensors it is giving me this error

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/16/2021 12:27:05
`@D26798` you only need to pass `ps0`, `WbDeviceTag` is the type. I suggest you do this tutorial before: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-4-more-about-controllers)

##### D26798 05/16/2021 14:33:04

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/16/2021 15:18:06
`@D26798` like I said you need to drop the `WbDeviceTag` and just call `wb_position_sensor_get_value(ps0)` as shown in the tutorial. Also, is `ps0` a global variable? Otherwise your function `compute_odometry` won't know what that is.

##### Daemongear 05/16/2021 17:21:43
Hey there. I'm trying to connect ROS with WeBots. I already have an Rviz launch file, the urdfs, protos, worlds setup, but I can't figure out how exactly I can connect RViz to the motor sensor feedbacks.


I figured that there should be a way to pass them to the joint\_state\_publisher, but I'm not sure how


as far as I have found, I still need to write a node to connect the two, where I simply take the results from the respective topics (whose names change each time) and plug them into their joint\_state.name and .position, then publish the results

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 20:50:55
your robot's controller has to get the sensor values and publish them

##### D26798 05/16/2021 21:28:46
Any i dea on what can cause these errors ??

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:31:44

and it's hard to say without seeing your code


can you upload your controller file here?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:39:44
`@Daemongear` are you using ROS or ROS2? If using ROS, did you use the default ROS controller

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:44:28
Okay, so first of all, you have wrong variable types. Check the reference manual: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor#wb\_position\_sensor\_get\_value](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor#wb_position_sensor_get_value)

get\_value is double, not int


`@D26798` I suggest you orient yourself on an example controller such as this one

change and expand it


understand its functionality

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/16/2021 21:47:01
```
static double compute_odometry() 

{
    WbDeviceTag ps[2];
    char ps_names[2][10] = { "ps0", "ps1"};

       for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        ps[i] = wb_robot_get_device(ps_names[i]);
        wb_distance_sensor_enable(ps[i], TIME_STEP);
}

    int l =  wb_position_sensor_get_value('ps0');
    
    int  r =  wb_position_sensor_get_value('ps1');
    
    
    // distance covered by left wheel in meter
    double dl = l / ENCODER_RESOLUTION * WHEEL_RADIUS;
    
    // distance covered by right wheel in meter
    double dr = r / ENCODER_RESOLUTION * WHEEL_RADIUS;
    
    // delta orientation
    double da = (dr - dl) / AXLE_LENGTH;

    X = X + (((dr + dl) / 2) * cos(da));
    Y = Y + (((dr + dl) / 2) * sin(da)); 
    
    // printf("X: %3.3f m | Y: %3.3f m | D: %3.3f\n", X, Y, da);

    // printf("estimated change of orientation: %g rad.\n", da);
    
    return da;
}
```

the brackets `{}` here make no sense, and you can't access the array `ps`, using `'ps0'`, but instead using `ps[0]`. Like I said before already, most of what you want to do is in the tutorial-4

##### D26798 05/16/2021 21:47:46
I'm using this one actually and my robot is just going forward


Ok I'll see what I'll get sorry for bothering I'm new to webots

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:48:37
Tutorials are your friend :). Try to do them first and understand them

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/16/2021 21:48:50
if you're not comfortable with c, you can use other languages like python or matlab

##### D26798 05/16/2021 21:49:39
The issue that I'm low on time and I'm using webots to simulate my university project that's why I'm not taking my time in reading tutorials

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:50:14
Is c as a programming language demanded by the professor?


You'll save lots of time using Python. Much quicker and easier to learn than c.

##### D26798 05/16/2021 21:51:19
No but i started with it and i don't have the time to restart using another language

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:51:41
believe me, you'll be faster with python

##### D26798 05/16/2021 21:52:31
Actually i tried python first but i didn't now how to run it


Know*

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:52:39
no compiling, easier syntax

##### D26798 05/16/2021 21:54:24
Is it possible that you can help me to do the code personally?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:54:44
pm me

##### Daemongear 05/16/2021 21:55:52
hey `@Simon Steinmann` sorry for the delay, I didn't notice the ping. I'm using ROS, and currently I'm using the standard ROS controller, as provided in the tutorials. I've advanced a bit in my search, and if I'm not mistaken, I should be able to remap the same controller that I have for RViz to the webots data. (I am also using an auto generated package from a Fusion360-urdf exporter, which provides launch files for RViz, including a basic controller and such.)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 21:58:11
`@Daemongear` when the simulation is running, do a` rostopic list` and see what is published. If i'm not mistaken, the standard ROS controller should automatically publish all sensors. You just have to select the appropiate topic in Rviiz

##### Daemongear 05/16/2021 23:08:36
yeah, but is rename enough to connect them to RViz if I model it right in  the launch file?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/16/2021 23:43:54
verify first that everything gets published


then just open rviz, make all the changes and save the config

##### Daemongear 05/17/2021 00:36:12
did that just fine, played around with the webots controller as well, I can get movement and feedback from the terminal via the rosservices


I do have to enable all the motor sensors first, then I can see them in the rostopic list, as expected


I have a launch file for RViz, with config and the proper project, but the launch file that I have declares a static joint\_state\_publisher source, or rather as I understand it, declares one but leaves it unconnected


so sorry to be responding so late, i have been in a meeting up until now

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/17/2021 00:38:03
just launch rviz. once it is open, add all the visualization you want. Then save the config

##### Daemongear 05/17/2021 00:38:12
did that too

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/17/2021 00:38:22
what is the issue then?

##### Daemongear 05/17/2021 00:38:32
having what I do in webots translate to rviz 🙂

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/17/2021 00:38:46
what exactly do you want to visualiize?

##### Daemongear 05/17/2021 00:39:11
the robot's internal movements (relative to itself, not an environment)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/17/2021 00:39:25
so just the joints moving?

##### Daemongear 05/17/2021 00:39:29
the joints being replicated, yeah


Hello, so as Simon (many thanks btw) asked, I'm rephrasing my question, maybe someone can help with advice. I want to publish the WeBots joints to the ROS joint\_state\_publisher. I am using the standard, tutorial ROS controller

so far the only options I've found were A) rewrite parts of the standard controller (which is heavily distributed of course) to get the joints directly published to the right topic or B) write my own node (much simpler) to subscribe to the default topics after enabling the motor sensors, and publish them to the joint\_state\_publisher. this would of course induce some delay.

Any other ideas?

##### harrymcc 05/17/2021 11:41:49
in a tutorial i have seen the code robot.getTime() but would be an equivalent in c?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/17/2021 11:43:49
Yes, the C function is `wb_robot_get_time()`. All the API functions are documented in the Reference Manual:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_time](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_time)

##### h.sciascia 05/17/2021 14:46:50
Hello everyone ! 

I have two robots with the same architecture and node names. 

For exemple, I have two RotationalMotor called "motor 0", two "motor 1", two "motor 2" etc



I would like to create two list which refers to the id of my two robots motors architecture and be sure that I do not get the same motor



I would like to do something like this :



`Robot1 = supervisor.getFromDef("Robot1")

Robot2 = supervisor.getFromDef("Robot2")



for link in armChain1.links:

    if 'moteur ' in link.name:

        motor = Robot1.getDevice(link.name)

        motors1.append(motor)

for link in armChain2.links:

    if 'motor ' in link.name:

        motor = Robot2.getDevice(link.name)

        motors2.append(motor)`



In the documentation we can use getDevice for the robot but i get the error : "AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'getDevice'"

Thank in advance !

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/17/2021 15:14:59
First, from a controller you can only access devices in the current robot and not devices from other robots.

Then, the `getDevice` is a method of the `Robot` object but your `Robot1` retrieved using the Supervisor API has the `Node` type.

So you should rather call `supervisor.getDevice` to retrieve the devices defined in the Robot node associated with the current controller.

##### h.sciascia 05/17/2021 15:17:27
Ok so I cannot use one controller for two same robots okok

Thanks

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/17/2021 15:18:32
You can use the same controller for multiple robots, but multiple instances of the same controller will be started

##### h.sciascia 05/17/2021 15:20:06
ok I will do two controller then if I cannot use something like Node.getDevice("#")

Thx

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/17/2021 15:23:27
You don't need the Supervisor API to identify the robot, you could for example set a unique name or set some value in the `Robot.customData` field or use the Supervisor simply to get the DEF name of the `supervisor.getSelf().getDef()` node but without using the returned node for getting the devices.

##### h.sciascia 05/17/2021 15:24:19
Oh okok I will try that ! Great

##### jmarsik 05/17/2021 16:22:01
Hello guys, is there any way to have a distance sensor that interacts with Solids (not their bounding boxes) and does not take into account the color (like the infra-red type)?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/17/2021 20:08:11
`@jmarsik` [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/17/2021 20:29:34
`@jmarsik` Laser/sonar and generic interact with `boundingObject`, infra-red with the solid itself. But since you can make the `boundingObject` as arbitrarily complex as you need it to be, the distinction shouldn't matter much. Can you explain more why you need it to interact with the solid instead of `boundingObject`? As for colored surfaces, only the infra-red is affected by it.


`@harrymcc` remembered to put `wb_robot_init();` and `wb_robot_cleanup();` ?

##### harrymcc 05/17/2021 20:39:05
yeah all thats in.  These lines seem to cause the issue   (not in order of code

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/17/2021 21:25:59
`@harrymcc` `wheel_radius` should be a double, if you set it as int it assigns it zero, not 0.025. Hence, also `linear_velocity` becomes zero and `duration_side` is infinity. Similarly, `wb_robot_get_time()` also returns a double, not a int. You should recheck all the types of your variables

I have a `MFFloat` field with 6 values, how can I access the 0th index in my PROTO?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/18/2021 06:17:52
You should use `wb_supervisor_node_get_proto_field` to get a handler to your field and then `wb_supervisor_field_get_mf_float` with `index=0` on it.

##### SeanLuTW 05/18/2021 06:21:44
I want to use these values in my PROTO instead of controller.


I found some examples here. ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/tests/protos/protos](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/tests/protos/protos))

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/18/2021 06:24:16
I see. You should then be able to access it as a Lua array. Note however that the first index in a Lua array is 1, not 0.

##### SeanLuTW 05/18/2021 06:26:02
Yes, the problem solved! But I wonder which language is PROTO file used, VRML or Lua?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/18/2021 06:27:23
It's the PROTO format (inspired from VRML97) to which you can apply Lua templating.

##### TheGiant 05/18/2021 07:29:01
Hello everyone,

I'm working with hydraulic actuators, which are commanded using a velocity. Their are really strong, hence their is two behavior : 1) when a velocity is requested, it's reached almost immediately (their is a internal regulation in it, which is very good, and I don't want to simulate it). I've tweaked the P[ID] value to get something nice, and also change the max force to something very large, which is what the actuator could do. If the requested velocity is positive (resp negative), then whatever the load the actuator will not output a negative (resp positive) speed. At worst it will not move.

2) When the velocity requested is 0, then the actuator will never move, (independently of the load), because the circuit in which the oil flow is closed.

For the moment, I'm using a linear motor, which seems to work fine, but not for a speed of 0 (the actuator retract because of the gravity and the load), which is actually logical.

Do you have any thought on that ?

I thought about using connector to "lock" the actuator when speed == 0, but its not pretty.

I thought also about adding a "lock" option to "transform" the motor in mechanical link when speed == 0.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/18/2021 07:33:24
Why not switching to position control instead of velocity control when velocity is 0?

##### TheGiant 05/18/2021 07:36:21
Yes, but I don't know which position should be used, and I'm not huge fan of adding a position sensor just for that (which don't exist in reality). Additionally, it will continue to cost time, because the solver will continue to regulate if some perturbation push it out of position, is it ?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/18/2021 07:39:13
Yes...

##### jmarsik 05/18/2021 08:46:16
That's right, but complex bounding objects really slow down physics computation and also make it unstable sometimes. Or at least that's my experience. But I will try it because it seems like the only option right now. Maybe another is to create a pull request and try to add a property like `red color sensitivity` that would tune this sensitivity by a factor (0..1) for infra-red sensors? But I am not confident if I have enough experience to do that.

##### TheGiant 05/18/2021 08:48:52
`@Olivier Michel` fyi, devil strike again : I'm been stuck on "Finalizing node" (oscillating weirdly between 19% and 99%) when creating (and so opening) a new project directory...Add to reboot my PC.


Is their any logs produced during file opening ?


And here we go again, but this time, stuck on "Opening world file" at 99%. SIGKILL send, htop confirm webots shutdown, but back in gui the windows is still here, screen frozen, with mouse cursor moving but messed up... 

I'm using a webots version built with "debug", but I don't expect to be the issue...

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/18/2021 09:09:21
Did you try to debug it with gdb?

##### TheGiant 05/18/2021 09:25:15
I'm not, actually, that would be interesting.


I'm currently rebuilding it on master with "release" makefile, and see if it change anything, I wil give gdb a try next


Well, that didnt go according to the plan :/ Master + release => same issue (actually, I don't even see the "loading world" popup)

Rebuild with "debug", on the branch makefile-improvement (to get -ggdb flags) did nothing more... gdb doesn't seems to catch anything. (but I can see m gdb output, cause screen freeze...)

I think I will reinstall ubuntu, and give it another try. Also I continu to also blame my pc on that one, I've got very strange stuff in the past 

At least it's consistant : run webots from command line with a fresh empty world, cause it to crash each time

##### jmarsik 05/18/2021 12:24:36
Ok, I tried to implement it and submitted a PR 🙂 [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/3077](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/3077)

##### ShuffleWire 05/19/2021 08:24:20
I've made progress ! 🙂 Trying to reinstall Ubuntu doesn't change the issue (however, now I could say that python3-dev and python-is-python3 are mandatory to build Webots (and docs) on a fresh Ubuntu install)

I've added info to the bug, it's nicely reproducible,  and I found the faulty line. Updated to related issue [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/3065](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/3065) . Hope it might help...

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/19/2021 13:09:57
Unfortunately, since we cannot reproduce this bug on our machines, you will have to continue to investigate on yours.

##### h.sciascia 05/19/2021 14:32:35
Hello everyone ! 

I  have a problem when I try to use PyQt5 with webots

The application seems to do not find PyQt 



If I uninstall PyQt everthing is ok



Do you have any clue ?

##### ftsell 05/20/2021 20:42:18
Hey folks,



I currently have the problem that webots starts lagging like crazy after resetting a world.

- Everything runs completely fine and smooth before the reset

- I don't have any controllers running

- I use this world: [https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang\_robot/blob/master/wolfgang\_webots\_sim/worlds/1\_bot.wbt](https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang_robot/blob/master/wolfgang_webots_sim/worlds/1_bot.wbt) (you can set the controllers to void)

- I was able to debug that our custom robot proto: [https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang\_robot/blob/master/wolfgang\_webots\_sim/protos/Wolfgang.proto](https://github.com/bit-bots/wolfgang_robot/blob/master/wolfgang_webots_sim/protos/Wolfgang.proto) seems to somehow be causing the problem because the simulation survives a reset when the robot is not in it.

- I am using `Webots version: R2021b Nightly Build 11/5/2021 1585fa928cccee28dbab882d925361a21369e727`



If anyone has any idea on how to debug this further I'd be happy to! Although imho it seems to be at least partially a webots internal problem since the problem only occurs after resetting the simulation.

##### mmoralesp 05/20/2021 21:45:03

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/20/2021 21:45:47
`@mmoralesp` use supervisor functionality or gps sensor


I downloaded your entire webots\_sim folder and there is many errors.


probably because i'm not on develop

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/21/2021 08:56:14
`@Variant L1130` Hi, it's because there's no light source on your world. Add the `Background` node, or `TexturedBackgroundLight` & `TexturedBackground` nodes for example, or something analogous to it

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/21/2021 19:22:57
Can you post the relevant part of the proto? Hard to say without

##### ftsell 05/21/2021 19:26:25
your controller is not valid python syntax. that's why it exits with an error exit code (1 in this case) and throws indentation errors.



If you want to have functions which don't have any implementation yet you can use the `pass` keyword like the following:

```
class MyClass:
    def my_function(self):
        pass
```

yes, using the supervisor functionality

double current_time = wb_robot_get_time(); is there anyway i can reset this current_time to 0 with code? 
``` if ( current_time > start_time + time + duration_side){
 left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right_speed = 0;
 }
 if ( current_time > start_time + time * 2){
  left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right\_speed = MAX\_SPEED;
``` currently im * with each turn but i want to find a way to turn it into a function that can be repeated instead of timesing

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/24/2021 14:23:57
Not without resetting the entire simulation. What you can do instead is to track the number of timesteps that have elapsed (at every call of `wb_robot_step`) instead of relying on simulation time

##### harrymcc 05/24/2021 14:28:27
okay thanks, so would basically change the current\_time to what ever i declare wb\_robot\_step as

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/24/2021 14:38:55
Depends what you're making, there's multiple options. You can keep a counter that you increase at every call of `wb_robot_step` (in the infinite loop for example) and change the program flow based on the counter value, or you call `wb_robot_step` by providing as argument the duration it has to similate, like `wb_robot_step(XX)` which will simulate the next XX ms.

##### harrymcc 05/24/2021 14:39:43
its just a simple 1 metre square


```double current_time = wb_robot_step(432);
 left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 
 if (current_time > start_time + duration_side){
 left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right_speed = 0;}
 if (current_time > start_time + duration_side + turn_time  ){
  left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right\_speed = MAX\_SPEED;
``` so something like that?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/24/2021 14:49:02
No, like 

```
action A

wb_robot_step(duration_action_A)

action B

wb_robot_step(duration_action_B)
```

##### harrymcc 05/24/2021 15:31:33
```  while (wb_robot_step(TIME_STEP) != -1) {
    left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 wb_robot_step(5000);
 left_speed = MAX_SPEED;
 right_speed = 0;
  wb\_robot\_step(10000);
``` think i have got hang of it nearly however one last question if you dont mind so after 15 second in spins on the spot but it doesnt do the first action. Am i meant to separate these further

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/24/2021 15:35:02
Why did you keep the infinite while loop? Doesn't make much sense to mix the two.

##### HiTF 05/24/2021 15:35:17
Hello!

##### harrymcc 05/24/2021 15:37:07
tbf im not sure im just doing some messing about because i have never really used the robot\_step and forgot aha

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/24/2021 15:38:23
Or  you want to have it run around the square multiple times? If so then sure you can have a `while(1)` around  the sequence

##### harrymcc 05/24/2021 15:40:20
no sorry it literally needs to go around once. What i mean is so when i added 1 timestep it did after 5 seconds i added the second set of instruction which was 10 seconds but instead of doing it in order it added the 5 seconds and 10 seconds together and only did the last step which has confused me abit

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/24/2021 16:02:50
Sorry I didn't understand much, but it could be due to the while loop messing things up. From what I understood you want to do, all you really need is something like:

```
while(1){ // or just do 4x times

action_go_straight

wb_robot_step(how_long_go_straight)

action_turn_on_itself

wb_robot_step(how_long_turn)
}
```

how do I import this object into my enviroment and use it ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/25/2021 07:38:38
You can use the `wb_supervisor_field_import_mf/sf_node` Supervisor functions:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node)

also I had another small question , I am trying to use the distance sensor in my robot


but whenever I try see the value of the distance sensor by using `print(ds.value())`


I get nan


how else do I see the current value being read by the sensor ?


This is my entire controller code that I am using for a robot which just has one child , distance sensor 
```from controller import Robot
from controller import LED
import time 

robot = Robot()

ds = robot.getDevice("distance sensor")
ds.enable(64)
print((ds.getValue()))
```

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/25/2021 09:10:25
You are missing the `step()`:

```py
from controller import Robot

robot = Robot()

ds = robot.getDevice("distance sensor")
ds.enable(64)
robot.step(64)
print(ds.getValue())
```

![robot.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/846736374548004884/robot.png)
%end


Everything so far seems OK but I am stuck on how ti create joints in Webots?


Track of the robots looks like this:
%figure
![track.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/846736631075700796/track.png)
%end


The motor(in below figure) powering the robot on each side is connected to the yellow parts in the above figure.
%figure
![motor_selected.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/846736877301006336/motor_selected.png)
%end


This motor rotates, which is coupled to the yellow part of the above figure. The assembly of the robot rotates(in the figure below) which rotates the tracks(second figure from above)


There are two adjustments wheels to tighten the tracks as desired. They rotate normally with the tracks.
%figure

I am not able to convert this mechanism to Webots anyone who can comment on how to create joints so that the tracks with all other assmebly and adjustments wheels rotates?


Thank you so much in advance for any suggestions

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 05/25/2021 17:13:46
`@Tahir` Hi, have you looked into the sample world `track.wbt`? You will need to use the `Track` and `TrackWheel` nodes. [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/track](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/track)

is that a nightly bug or an API change?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/26/2021 14:11:40
What is the `box_node` a node visible in the scene tree, a PROTO internal node or a base node?


Which nighlty are you testing? R2021b or R2021a-rev1?


We fixed an issue in R2021b with the `getPosition` function. It would be good if you could provide an example where this function is not working as you expect.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/26/2021 14:36:27
We added `wb_supervisor_node_get_pose`:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2932](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2932)

but we the `wb_supervisor_node_get_position` should still work.

##### Matt Estrada 05/26/2021 16:58:43
Hello! I am interested in aquatic simulation of an amphibious robot we are developing in the Biorobotics Lab at EPFL. We have implemented this in the past via `Fluid Nodes` and `Immersion Properties` . 



We are curious about a more complex interaction than  a single direction of fluid flow-- perhaps to implement flow along a "river" that might curve and simulate "flow" of this fluid in different directions, which could lead to some interesting motion planning problems. 



I notice `streamVelocity` as part of a [Fluid]([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/fluid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/fluid)) node seems to implement a single direction of flow. Do you know if anyone has tried to vary this streamVelocity, or any node's property, while the simulation was running? If so, this might allow us imitate a water flow that changes with respect to the robot's position in the map. 



Not sure if I'm missing a higher level API for changing node properties in general that I might be able to use to attain this desired effect...

##### robert.hobbs 05/26/2021 18:12:56
Matt,  I was just reviewing the discord channel before asking the same question.

##### mclzc 05/26/2021 21:21:20
Where could I find more information on how to translate Gazebo URDF to PROTO files? 



I know and have used the `xacro2proto` script (which underneath uses `urdf2webots`),  but I don't really know what did it do and to what extent did it work. I see the Gazebo robot that I'm using being rendered in Webots... but I'm completely clueless of if it's a complete and successful translation into the PROTO format. The first question that comes to my mind is, "are the sensors correctly defined in the PROTO file now?"



In this Github question ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/issues/112](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/issues/112)) I have found the first piece of information that I have not seen around in the Webots tutorials that I've come across: `Why not introduce a <webots> xml tag instead of parsing the <gazebo> tags?`. Now I know that the script is indeed gazebo-tags aware and will look into the code, but would be nice to know what is it capable of.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 05/27/2021 05:50:36
Here the list of pre-configured sensors in Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/sensors#commercially-available-sensors](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/sensors#commercially-available-sensors). You can use a Kinect if you need a RGBD camera, or implement a Intel Realsense from basic sensors:  RGB camera + range finder camera: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera) + [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder).


You can use the supervisor API to change any field of any node (including the `streamVelocity` field). See this example to change a field from a supervisor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming#setting-the-position-of-robots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/supervisor-programming#setting-the-position-of-robots)


Turn that object into a Transform (instead of a Solid)?


The best way is probably to study the source code the `urdf2webots` script, study the content of the URDF and PROTO files to determine how successful the conversion was. This `urdf2webots` script is constantly evolving and improving, but still has some limitations for some specific cases, you are welcome to contribute to improve it if you spot any problem.

Yes, simply setting a RGB color with less intensity (lighter or darker) should work.

##### bingdong 05/27/2021 06:25:37

using 2021b

the node is an instanciated proto.

getting the relative position works fine with box\_node.getField("translation").getSFVec3f()

`

getPose() works also (What is getPose btw, the same as getPosition AND getOrientation()?)


box\_node.getPosition()

[nan, nan, nan]

(Pdb) box\_node.getPose()

[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.455, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -1.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]

Hi guys👋  I hope you can help me with my (probably far too easy to solve) question. I´m using python and got my Lidar sensor working. Right now I calculate the coordinates of every point with the values of getRangeImage and the angular position of the lidar. It´s painfull 😂  To my suprise there is the easy solution getting the coordinates from LidarPoint.*. But I can´t figure out how to access those values. In the WB doc theres something written about @property. Never worked with that. If I want to get one coordinate of a point it says "<property object at 0x000002990325B9A0>". Thank you so much!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/27/2021 11:27:12
Can share the part of the code in which you are accessing the point data?

##### James Le Poidevin 05/27/2021 13:23:19
OK i thought i would have to try that. Do you think it would be possible to use one elevation grid or will i have to use multiple one that i load one by one ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 05/27/2021 13:57:03
It would probably be easier to have multiple elevation grids

hello, I have used camera recognition in webots using python. I did everything according to the resources but I have 2 major issue. 1. values is updating only 0  

2.  It says the index exceeds the list....







I need some basic pre-build code in *Python*  atleast to get id using camera recognition... Other things I can manage with that reference.

##### Matt Estrada 05/27/2021 19:00:17

##### Robot 05/27/2021 19:53:30
I have an environment where i need to recognize an object (Wooden Box) and reach that location. I am using E-Puck for my project. I got how to recognize the object which is inbuilt. Not sure what logic should i follow once i detect it.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/27/2021 23:07:16
`@Robot` [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#camera)


you can enable recognition

##### Jhon mathew 05/28/2021 02:13:25
please someone give basic code in python..  I need to get information about recognised object.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 02:14:16
recognitionObjects = camera.getRecognitionObjects()

    if len(recognitionObjects) > 0:

        recognitionPosition = recognitionObjects[0].get\_position()

        recognitionSize = recognitionObjects[0].get\_size()


` camera.getRecognitionObjects()` returns a list, so when there is no recognized objects, the list is empty


objects need their recognition color field defined in order to be detected

##### Jhon mathew 05/28/2021 03:07:57
thank you. ill try that now


Object is detecting by the camera. I have done some minor mistake.. thank you

##### Robot 05/28/2021 04:31:44
Thanks Simon, but I think Epuch does not has Recognition node. Because when i do camera.hasRecognition(), it gives false. Can you guide me how to add one.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 04:32:19
you have to enable recognition mode


use the api documentation


camera = robot.getDevice('camera')

camera.enable(timeStep)

camera.recognitionEnable(timeStep)


something like that

##### Robot 05/28/2021 05:03:46
Yeah i tried that but its giving me below error: Error: wb\_camera\_recognition\_enable() called on a Camera without Recognition node.


I tried this


camera = robot.getDevice("camera")

    camera.enable(time\_step)

    camera.recognitionEnable(time\_step)


where robot is EPuck robot

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 05:22:53
you might have to check the camera node, or maybe add a recognition color to the bot and or the camera

##### Cyber Police Officer 05/28/2021 10:19:58
I've tried to search the documentation, but didn't find any information about this. Is it possible, using the propeller node, to make a propeller have a different thrust coefficient depending on the rotation direction? 



I know i can workaround using two propellers, facing in opposite directions, having each the correct thrust coefficient, but was wondering if there were a cleaner way.



Thank you

Can anyone tell how to add recognition colors to the WoodenBox in webots

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 21:36:47
`@Robot` you have to convert it to Base Nodes (right click). Then you can add the colors

##### Robot 05/28/2021 21:37:14
Thanks simon. I will try that.


And one more thing I have got the object recognized. And I am not able to understand what is the difference between position and position\_on\_image in the API?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 21:39:07
read the text under the commands. It explains it


are you working on the vacuum project as well?

##### Robot 05/28/2021 21:39:44
Yeah i read it but not able to understand what it says exactly. I am getting x and y values in that


No I am working on my own college Project

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 21:40:17
> The position\_on\_image and size\_on\_image can be used to determine the bounding box of the object in the camera image, the units are pixels

##### Robot 05/28/2021 21:40:57
Does it give the center of the bounding box of the recognised object?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 21:41:06
I would assume so

##### Robot 05/28/2021 21:41:11
Okay


and what does just Position gives ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/28/2021 21:41:41
it gives the relative position of the recognized object to the camera


as a sidenote: get\_size() has a bug in the current release, where it returns a integer instead of a float. So you will get the size rounded to the next full meter. Install the the latest nightly build if that is the case for you

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 05/31/2021 01:11:46
`@viorel_gheorghe` you should google that for the programming language that you use. This is not Webots specific

##### viorel\_gheorghe 05/31/2021 05:05:44
`@Simon Steinmann`, I'm using Python. I thought there is an in-built feature of the controller since it can print the evolution on the sensors  if selected

##### hanm 05/31/2021 10:28:46
hi, I have met some problem about webots, a create a env which have a ur10e robot and a conveyor belt. I set the ur10e  as a supervisor and I want the ur10e controller can enable a kinect which is a child in the conveyor belt, but I failed to enable it.


my code is :


ur10erobot = Supervisor()



\# Get the time step of the current world.

timestep = int(ur10erobot.getBasicTimeStep())



conveyor\_belt = ur10erobot.getFromDef("CONVEYOR\_BELT")

assert(conveyor\_belt != None)

conveyor\_kinectcolor = conveyor\_belt.getDevice("kinect color")

conveyor\_kinectcolor.enable(int(1000/24))


the error report is :


conveyor\_kinectcolor = conveyor\_belt.getDevice("kinect color")

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 05/31/2021 10:46:11
It is not possible to control device of another robot, i.e. in your case you cannot controller the conveyor belt devices from the ur10e controller if they are two distinct robots.

Many different solutions exists depending of the specific use case.

One option could to use the Emitter/Receiver mechanism to send a message from the ur10e controller to the conveyor belt controller notifying that the Kinect should be enabled.

Adding "true" extra sensors is difficult, but may be achieved with physics plugins [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin) . You can also try using existing sensors. Camera with object recognition comes to mind. You could store information such as PH and Temp in the recognition color values (RGB, so you have 3 values) [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#camera-recognition-object](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#camera-recognition-object)

What do you think is the best approach to do this (im new to webots).

Just using the motion file and doing the forward motion for a certain time (dependend on my distance)? Or is there a better approach ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/01/2021 22:18:16
`@Ayk` you can turn the wheels an exact angle. Together with its radius, you can calculate the distance.

Do you guys have any suggestion ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/02/2021 02:35:51
The robot has to be a supervisor (checkbox in the scene tree)


`from controller import Supervisor` instead of Robot

##### Kirlin 06/02/2021 02:36:52
yep, I've done that


but I capture the robot node like self.natasha = Robot()


and then I operate self.natasha with all the functions


when I import Supervisor


how can I capture the Robot node ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/02/2021 02:37:57
self.natasha = Supervisor()


it has all the Robot functionality

##### Kirlin 06/02/2021 02:39:10
wow


I have tried so many things


I was trying self.supervisor = Supervisor and then self.natasha = supervisor.getFromDef('Natasha') or getSelf()


so now I can just operate self.natasha with the Robot functions and the Supervisor functions ?


thank you so much

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/02/2021 07:25:52
No, only the Lidar publishes `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2`. Can you contribute `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` for the range finder? Although I am not sure whether it is better to implement the point cloud generation in the Webots core. Please open the issue about that so we can discuss.

so for my university's robotics team, we want to train our neural network to detect a ball and a robot. we have a webots simulation of our robot working and we would like some way to automate the process of getting images from the simulation. manual taking screenshots would be incredibly tedious so we want some way to automate getting pictures of the robot and the ball and goalpost at different angles and distances. is there any way to do this?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 06:10:53
Sure, you can use `wb_camera_save_image` API function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb\_camera\_save\_image](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera#wb_camera_save_image) combined with moving the robot to different locations/orientations using a supervisor process.

##### sk 06/03/2021 06:12:20
is there a way to automate moving the robot?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 06:12:56
The easiest is probably to use a supervisor process that will change the translation/rotation fields of the robot.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 13:05:22
It is not necessary to set the velocity at each simulation step. Once set it is applied automatically to the robot at each step. To stop the robot you have to reset the motor velocity to 0.

##### Rody El Hamod 06/03/2021 13:06:00
but it seems strange to me that there's no limitation. at the end of the day it's a physics simulator..

##### Dee 06/03/2021 13:09:37
so i should do wb\_motor\_set\_velocity(left\_motor, 0 * MAX\_SPEED); wb\_motor\_set\_velocity(right\_motor, 0 * MAX\_SPEED); after the while loop i assume?

ive added it and recompiled it, the e puck doesnt move now

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 13:11:49
Instead of sleep you should call `wb_robot_step(TIME_STEP)` and the loop condition should be based on the simulation time and not the system time

##### Dee 06/03/2021 13:12:12
how would i make it based off the simulation time?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 13:12:52
A simple way would be to simply count the number of times the loop body is executed (and multiply it by `TIME_STEP`).

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 13:19:09
`@harrymcc` Hi, because you define the variables `left_speed` and `right_speed` but don't actually set the motor speed to those values. Before each of those `wb_robot_step`  calls you should call `wb_motor_set_velocity`

Hello! I'm doing a remote controlled delivery drone and I wanted to control it through external client application. I'm trying to create a scenario where I connect to it, connection is lost, simulation goes on for a while, and after some time connection is re-established.

I've seen the khepera\_tcpip example, but my problem is that whenever the socket is listening for connections, it completely stops whole simulation. Is there any way to listen for connection while the simulation is running?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/03/2021 15:45:49
You should use either non-blocking sockets or multi-threading.

##### FlamingToaster 06/03/2021 15:51:19
Thanks for answer! Also this is what I was afraid of, since I've never done either. Anyway, which approach would you suggest? From what I've gathered it's not advised to go on the multi-threading route when using webots

Hello, I've just tried to pass to the new webots\_ros2 and webots version and when tring to lanch the webots\_ros2 exemples i keep getting the same error :

```
ImportError: /opt/ros/foxy/lib/python3.8/site-packages/webots_ros2_msgs/webots_ros2_msgs_s__rosidl_typesupport_c.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: webots_ros2_msgs__msg__wb_camera_recognition_object__convert_to_py

Do you know why ? (tested with mavic and abb)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/04/2021 10:58:32
You are compiling from source?

##### James Le Poidevin 06/04/2021 11:02:41
webots no, but i run colcon build for webots\_ros2


webots works fine by itself

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/04/2021 11:04:07
`webots_ros2_msgs` is coming from `/opt` which means that the compiled `webots_ros2` package and the one installed through apt are clashing. Delete the `webots_ros2` using apt.

##### James Le Poidevin 06/04/2021 11:06:42
i didn't use apt to install webots\_ros2. To install webots\_ros2 i cloned the github repo and changed branch to develop


by using locate I can see that webots\_ros2 is present in only 2 places: where I installed it(using git clone) and in the /opt/ros/foxy/...

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/04/2021 12:10:34
Run:

```bash
apt list --installed | grep webots-ros2
```

to identify whether you have `webots_ros2` installed.



And this should delete everything related to `webots_ros2`:

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge ros-foxy-webots*
```

##### Rody El Hamod 06/04/2021 12:28:43
hello i have a question about setPosition for a rotational motor.

does webots choose the shortest path between 2 angles? if the start angle is pi and the target angle is -3.13 will the rotational motor do almost a full rotation or it will move just a bit as it should?

##### James Le Poidevin 06/04/2021 13:44:18
I tried it but still the same error, I've also just seen that I have this at the beginning for the launch `[mavic_driver-3] Cannot open file: /tmp/webots-154849-kTJ9Hr/WEBOTS_SERVER (retry count 8)` I don't know if there's a max number of retries

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/04/2021 15:45:50
I am not sure whether it is safe to delete the folder:

```
rm -rf /opt/ros/foxy/lib/python3.8/site-packages/webots_ros2*
```

There is limit of around 60s (10 retries) if you are using Webots R2021a, or no limit if you are using Webots R2021b.

I have a task of measuring 50cm 25cm 7cm away from an object with the e-puck however the prox sensors dont seem to have the range to measure out 50cm and 25cm is there anyway to increase the range

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/04/2021 16:20:45
`@harrymcc` hi, the range and response of the distance sensor can be modified by changing the look-up table of the device. Here's the details: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)

`@Dee` Put in some print statements, so you can see which line the controller is crashing at.

##### Dee 06/05/2021 13:11:19
i tried that but all i got out of the console was WARNING: my\_controller: The process crashed some time after starting successfully.

WARNING: 'my\_controller' controller crashed.

##### TerryWr1st 06/05/2021 13:14:57
Does it run if you replace line 17 with int miliseconds = 1;



?

##### Dee 06/05/2021 13:22:30
yeah

##### TerryWr1st 06/05/2021 13:27:57
Velocity should be a double, not an int, try that


And rotational speed/time


All doubles


Any variable that will be initialised or could return as an decimal number will need to be a float or a double.

##### Dee 06/05/2021 13:34:52
alright it sorta works now its not crashing, thanks so much for your help

##### TerryWr1st 06/05/2021 13:47:38
All good. But basically for your code, try to keep all your sensor updating/kinematic updates/decision making within the loop on line 38 if you can. The other loop doesnt seem necessary?



For velocity control (you are using velocity control because the kinematics is controlled by setVelocity, not setPosition) you can just check the position at each timestep. Something like below pseudo code:



Update kinematic model (the position, orientation etc)

if position\_achieved, update velocity to stop, turn or whatever you want

else, do nothing, wait for next timestep

##### Dee 06/05/2021 13:50:03
yeah i got confused by how that loop on line 38 worked


i see what you mean tho thanks 🙂

##### TerryWr1st 06/05/2021 13:51:27
I'll see if I can find a slide on the kinematic model of the epuck, so you can see the equations

##### Dee 06/05/2021 13:53:01
that would be great thanks 🙂

How to import CAD model in Webots?

You have to convert it to some other format and then use `Import 3D Model... `. Check the following link for the supported formats:

##### mihir 06/07/2021 11:07:26
I want to have a supervisor to apply a algorithm on the camera data(in Matlab) on another robot, can anyone suggest a way to do so. Thank you in advance.


Particularly I wanted to get the depth data of the kinect.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/07/2021 11:46:24
You cannot access devices from another robot. You have to create a custom mechanism to retrieve depth data from another robot, it can be based on Emitter/Receiver or something else.

##### mihir 06/07/2021 11:47:52
Okay will try using emitter/receiver.


I am trying the emitter and receiver, but I am not sure how I can send the kinect data as the wb\_range\_finder\_get\_range\_image() returns a pointer. Could you suggest how I should proceed as I didn't find any documentation regarding sending depth data. Currently I am receiving a null vector. Any help is appreciated.

##### nap 06/07/2021 18:39:23
Hi, I've created a 'forklift' attachment to an epuck that uses a linear motor to move the forks up and down.  However, when I place a pallet over the forks and try to lift the pallet, the forks simply pass through the pallet.  What haven't I setup?


A reference to an example would suffice.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/07/2021 18:41:48
Hi, you should first make sure that you correctly define the boundingObject of the fork and the pallet. Physics doesn't use the graphical appearance but just geometries defined in `Solid.boundingObject` field.

##### nap 06/07/2021 18:42:22
I have bounding boxes on the forks, but not the pallet.


Actually, the boundingObject on the pallet is set to TRUE

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/07/2021 18:51:20
Here is an example sending a simple double array:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/gps\_supervisor/gps\_supervisor.c#L44](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/devices/controllers/gps_supervisor/gps_supervisor.c#L44)

Sending the range image would be similar, but you would need to also send additional information like the image size. This is commonly called "serialization" and depending on the programming language you  use it may be available in standard libraries.


If theboundingObject is correctly defined (you should see the outline when selecting the objects in the 3D scene), the second step is to check if both the fork and the pallet have are dynamic and thus if their `Physics` node is defined.

##### nap 06/07/2021 18:53:47
My slider joint endpoint is a solid that has three children (the backing plate (shape) and two forks (solids/shapes)).


Ok, all the physics on the forklift are null.  The pallet has no real options for physics and dynamics, just boundingObject = TRUE.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/07/2021 18:56:10
For the pallet, if it is the default one, you can enable the physics by setting its mass.

##### nap 06/07/2021 18:57:44
Mass == 0 right now.  Is that enabled?  Or does it have to be >0?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/07/2021 18:58:10
If mass is 0, then physics is disabled. You should set a positive mass.

##### nap 06/07/2021 19:02:14
lol.

When I lift the forks, they go through the pallet.  But when I try to lower the forks back to the floor, the epuck is jacked up when the forks touch the top of the pallet.  I can't get the forks back under the pallet.


The forks are passing through the empty gaps in the pallet, but maybe the bounding box of the pallet does not consider this?  If that's the case, then the forks are starting inside the pallet, which explains why they come out but can't go back through it.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/07/2021 19:07:14
> The forks are passing through the empty gaps in the pallet, but maybe the bounding box of the pallet does not consider this?

The default PROTO models empty gaps only in one direction. But you can modify it and re-redefine the bounginObject if this doesn't fit your needs.

##### nap 06/07/2021 19:09:55
I'm going to put the pallet on top of something so it's not sitting directly on the floor.  However, I've just discovered that a box has a minimum size, that is too big for my needs.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/07/2021 19:11:11
Minimum size for boxes is anything greater than 0.

##### nap 06/07/2021 19:13:39
Not quite.  I can't make a WoodenBox that is 0.0006^3.  I tried with a SolidBox and it seems to be working.


Is it normal to have an 'earthquake' near the start of a run?  A second or so into it but before anything dynamic has happened.

I'm going to check the wbt file for big/small numbers.


Ok, I've worked it out.  A combination of saving after running (thus having very large/small numbers) and the masses were too large for an epuck, so I needed to reduce them down to the order of 0.0007 kg.

##### yash 06/08/2021 06:27:55
Hello ! If I set the world coordinate system to “ENU”, then does the local reference frame of the robot,solids , rectangular arena set to “ENU”. ? Because if I set global frame to ENU , then the robot or rectangular arena frame doesn’t align with the global frame. So is it possible to make everything follow ENU.?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/08/2021 08:12:10
Coordinate system (e.g. ENU) and object orientation (e.g. FLU) are not related although there are often used in the same context. ENU stands for x-East, y-North, and z-Up, while FLU stands for x-Forward, y-Left, and z-Up.



You have to convert objects individually to follow the FLU convention. We plan to convert all existing PROTOs to FLU after June.

##### yash 06/08/2021 09:22:19
oh okay, so should I the rotation field to convert to FLU ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/08/2021 09:33:23

Yes, you can use change fields using the supervisor functions. Or you can change the LED type.

##### Lucas Waelti 06/09/2021 11:58:04
Hi, is there a way to rotate the camera in the 3D window around its own position without clicking on the background? I have a world where there are tight spaces and no way of clicking on the background. Since the space is tight, in place rotations of the view point are required to not go through obstacles. 

> **Camera rotation**: In the 3D window, click on an object with the left mouse button and drag the mouse to rotate the viewpoint around it. If you click on the background, the camera will rotate around its own position.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/09/2021 12:00:10
You can change the parameters in the `Viewpoint` node (in the scene tree). Also, since you are in the tight space you might benefit from a bigger field of view (`fieldOfView`)

##### Lucas Waelti 06/09/2021 12:05:59
Thanks for the hints, but I was thinking of a way of navigating with the mouse. For instance, `ctrl` + `left click` (or smth similar) could force a rotation in place instead of around the selected object... Editing the `Viewpoint` node directly for navigation (typically while developing a world) is not convenient.

But yes, increasing the field of view already helps (although not totally sufficient), thanks 👍

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/09/2021 13:26:04
You can use the Keyboard API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard)) in conjunction with the Supervisor API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)) to achieve the desired behavior. Once the key combination is detected you use the Supervisor to manipulate the fields inside the Viewpoint node.



I am not sure whether it is a good idea to include something like that in the Webots core. You can open an issue to discuss

Does anyone know why this happend?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/09/2021 22:55:10
`@Troy` can you post your actual code?


and is it a PROTO? or a robot made of base nodes?

##### Troy 06/10/2021 01:13:50
It is a robot made of base nodes


WbNodeRef Body;

WbFieldRef Body\_Field; 

const double Y\_angle[4] = {0,1,0,0};



in main:

Body = wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def("Body");

  Body\_Field = wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field(Body, "Body\_Field" );



wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_rotation(Body\_Field,Y\_angle);

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/10/2021 06:12:10
`@Troy` Hi, have you verified that the WbNodeRef and WbFieldRef are not NULL? Also, when getting the field using `wb_supervisor_node_get_field`, the field name must coincide with what appears on the scene tree. So in your case it would be: `wb_supervisor_node_get_field(Body, "rotation");`

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/10/2021 06:39:15
Did you set an image texture for the floor where the pen is painting?

The problem could be the texture resolution, so I would suggest you to set the appearance of the floor and set a completely white texture with a good resolution (for example you can try with 1024x1024). In case the texture is already set, you should try to replace with a texture with higher resolution.

##### Johan2021 06/10/2021 08:00:04
Hi, is there a way to implement vibrations inside Webots, or to sense their intensity?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/10/2021 08:05:31
You can use the `wb_supervisor_node_add_force` function to apply random force to an object: 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)

Hello, I'm wondering why webots don't use all my core when doing simulation ? I've set more than 1 core in both webots preference, and in the model, but it doesn't seem to affect. I've only one robot, is it why I could use only one core ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/10/2021 16:00:24
It is very hard to run the physics simulation on multiple cores. If you have multiple robots that don't interact with each other and `optimalThreadCount` is greater than 1 then Webots will use multiple cores. Otherwise it will stick to a single core. This is a limitation of the current physics engines in general.

##### TheGiant 06/10/2021 16:02:26
Yep, got it, seems legit ! We plan to use webots in a gitlab pipeline CI/CD, and so get the simulation run as fast as possible (server got many core to spare). But It will do the job for now !

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/10/2021 16:04:31
You can try some tricks to optimize the simulation:

##### TheGiant 06/10/2021 16:11:40
Currently, I've been doing only proof-of-concept, so everything is rather poorly designed, but I'm currently reworking all of it. 

My main concern was the addition of a lidar, which eat a lot of performance... (it's 715 point, but still).

Additionally, I'm sometime stuck with a linear motor which can't move (speed control mode) even if the max force is huge (10k N) and mas very light (10kg). I'm working with hydraulic arm, hence I've kinematic loop. Could they cause any issue, at solver level, which could cause non convergence or so ? My arm act like if mechanical links were "gripped" :/

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/10/2021 17:12:31
The lidar scan is processed on GPU while point cloud generation is done on CPU (something we want to optimize). 



If you believe the linear motor issue is a bug then please open an issue.

It is a ToF sensor, that one has a range of 2m. There is only one ToF sensor on e-puck2, the others are ultrasonic.


You can use `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf/mf_node_from_string`:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)

so this only relates to the E-puck2 then? how would i change the distance sensors of the normal E-Puck?


because thats the only lookup table i could find for the e-puck

##### Caio Viturino 06/11/2021 12:23:05
Hello! I am trying to use a STL model in Webots in robot grasping applications but I still can't figure out how to stabilize the BoundingObject in Webots.

This is what happens when I import the mesh...

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcTyDNSJoKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcTyDNSJoKE)



It is highly important to have a BoundingObject as the same shape of the geometry


I tried to set all kind of ContactProperties between the objects but no success


Has anyone ever tried to do this?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/11/2021 12:30:08
I would strongly recommend to to approximate the boundingObject with a series of basic primitives (Spheres, Capsules, Boxes, Cylinders) instead of a complex mesh which yields to instabilities. You can compose arbitrarily complex boundingObjects with compound solids, see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes)

##### Caio Viturino 06/11/2021 12:37:15
Thank you `@Olivier Michel`. I'll try it 🙂


`@Olivier Michel` .. it works!

I finally implemented robotic grasping in Webots using depth camera, RGB camera and transforming it into Point Clouds in order to visualize it in RVIZ.

`@harrymcc` something like this:

thanks  for help, It work!


I find the function `wb_supervisor_field_remove_sf/mf`, this function need a param `index`, but how can a get a solid node's index of the scene tree?


I try

```
robot = Supervisor()

root_node = robot.getRoot()
root_children_field = root_node.getField("children")

box_node = robot.getFromDef('box3')
idx = box_node.getId()

root_children_field.removeMF(idx)
```


but the idx is `4029` which is out of range

##### harrymcc 06/12/2021 17:32:19
can the pen node draw over the default tile flooring? just cant get it working for some reason

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/12/2021 17:40:11
`@harrymcc` did you change the `floorSize` ? If so, you also need to change `floorTileSize` by the same amount, otherwise the lines might not be visible.


`@hanm` Hi, from what I understood, you want to remove a node from the children list of a Robot, however the `getRoot()`, returns the reference to the Group that contains all top-most level nodes of the scene tree (so stuff like background, worldinfo etc), not the reference of the Robot.

##### harrymcc 06/12/2021 17:47:02
i have reset it back and still wont must be my code thats wrong might have missed read it

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/12/2021 17:50:17
I was talking about the RectangleArena/CircleArena, did you change its `floorSize` parameters?

Hi, I am following through the tutorials regarding use of webots with ROS2; and I was able to import a URDF of a Kuka iiwa robot and lauch a joint\_state\_controller\_gui to control the joints, this is working in webots.  However, I want to be able to get the coordinate frames of each link from webots.  What is the API call to get the frame of a given link of the imported robot?

##### nap 06/14/2021 02:45:55
When using a LinearMotor, how can its position be determined?  There doesn't seem to be a `getPosition` method. (Note this isn't necessarily the same as its `target_position`.)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/14/2021 05:51:40
`@nap` you can add a position sensor to the device list and retrieve it using the `getValue` method

##### nap 06/14/2021 05:53:02
Thanks Daniel, I've just done that and now I'm working on making the motor track my commands.


`getValue` should report values between the min/max positions of the linear motor?  I assume the units are the same.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/14/2021 05:56:17
Yes, for a linear motor the units are meters

`@hanm` since you obtained the `WbNodeRef` using `getFromDef` you can simply use `box_node.remove()` to remove the box.

`@Darko Lukić` Thank you for pointing that out. How can I install 2021b?  In the meantime, I did take a look at the existing documentation for version 2021a, and from what I understand there is a method .getPosition, [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position) however, when I call that method on  a Node, object, I get an AttributeError exception

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/14/2021 11:57:30
`getPosition` + `getOrientation` is also fine to get a pose.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/15/2021 07:09:01
That's probably due to some mix-up between DEF and USE nodes. Please check that DEF nodes are defined first, before being USEd.

There is a `webots` submodule in the `webots_ros2_driver` that contains necessary dependencies. Is there any way for you to check why your CMake is ignoring the content from `webots_ros2_driver/webots`?



If you don't need the C++ interface you can 

```bash
colcon build --packages-ignore webots_ros2_driver webots_ros2_turtlebot webots_ros2_control`
```

In any case, please open an issue so we can reproduce the problem

##### mclzc 06/15/2021 14:03:43
Oh thanks `@Darko Lukić` , I see what's the problem now. I was doing exactly this:

`git clone --recurse-submodules -b $ROS_DISTRO [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2.git](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2.git) src/webots_ros2`

And then I switched branches to master (`-b` was taking me to the foxy branch by default, which doesn't have the new `webots_ros2_driver` package) which doesn't have the pulled `webots` submodule.



Either removing the `-b $ROS_DISTRO` or doing `git submodule update --init --recursive` after checking out master solves it. Thanks.

if (acc == -1.0 || acc > mMotorForceOrTorque)

    acc = mMotorForceOrTorque;

If I get thing right, acc is in m/s², and mMotorForceOrTorque in N or Nm (depending on the motor)

That make them incompatible for comparison or affectation :/ 

Did I missed something ?

##### mclzc 06/17/2021 15:00:05
Thanks `@Darko Lukić` , I don't see that error anymore.



1) I however see one repetitive message hundreds of times: 

`[driver-3] wb_device_init(): node not handled`



2) If I follow the instructions here:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/SLAM-with-TurtleBot3](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/SLAM-with-TurtleBot3)

RViz opens up but throws this message forever:

`[occupancy_grid_node-2] [WARN] [1623941505.604937197] [occupancy_grid_node]: submap_slices and last_frame_id is empty`

And the Turtlebot doesn't really move.



3) Similarly with the Navigation2 tutorial:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Navigate-TurtleBot3](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Navigate-TurtleBot3)



`[controller_server-4] [INFO] [1623941695.908499944] [local_costmap.local_costmap]: Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to odom to become available, tf error: Invalid frame ID "odom" passed to canTransform argument target_frame - frame does not exist`



4) `ros2 topic list` shows me:

```
/joint_states
/parameter_events
/robot_description
/rosout
/tf
/tf_static
```

Which don't really echo anything.





I guess something is missing?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/17/2021 15:25:17

##### bingdong 06/21/2021 11:39:58
Hi, I'm trying to simulate a differential drive robot in Webots. It's derived from a fairly simple CAD file which has several parts assembled together for the body and wheels. 



After importing it into Webots, I set HingeJoint for the two wheels (end point Solid had the children: tyre, rim, axle, gear) and Hinge2Joint for the front castor wheel (End point Solid; Spherical Shape from CAD file). The rest of the body is children nodes of a Solid, which itself is a child node of a Transform.

 [Robot>Transform>Solid>(SolidPartA>ShapeA), (SolidPartB>ShapeB)...]



I have activated physics for the wheels with the tyre as the bounding object and for the physics for the Robot with ShapeA as the bounding object. However, the simulation isn't performing well. The robot falls back throught the floor and keeps revolving instead of moving forward. I assume that's because I haven't structured the nodes properly and set the bounding object correctly for the Robot. Any help with be greatly appreciate.

I followed the instructions on that page but my controller runs though doesn't stop at my breakpoint.

I set my robot's controller to "<extern>" (and saved it). 

I ran 'gdb myController'  (I did 'info sources' to confirm debug symbols were loaded.)

I used "break myContollerClass.cpp:1100" (gdb was able to do tab completion as I entered the name of the file, and showed the memory location of the breakpoint.)

I then typed `run` in gdb, and gdb printed "Starting program: path/to/controller" and indicated it created a new thread for the process, but did not stop.

(*my breakpoint is in a function called from the run loop*)



I then went into my Webots World and pressed the "RUN" button but the time did not start advancing.

(so my controller is waiting for Webots and Webots is waiting for my controller.)



Any tips?

`@Darko Lukić` :  Interesting.

1st:  Thanks for the instructions.  Essentially they work.

2nd: However, gdb is unreliable as **sometimes**, instead of stopping at the first breakpoint, it simply runs the controller and basically hangs. (Nothing happens in Webots and I have to kill the process.)  Re-running gdb again, usually causes the next run to actually stop at a breakpoint.

3rd: My controller crashes on a unlikely line: `iteration++` (where iteration is defined as an int32\_t). (Seg fault )

4th: Sometimes my controller runs one pass through the run loop but I can't get it to make another iteration as I get a bus error.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/21/2021 14:53:23
> 2nd: However, gdb is unreliable as sometimes

Hmm, gdb is typically quite stable for me.

You can do `bt` to see what caused the segmentation fault.

##### nap 06/21/2021 14:57:16

line 284 is:   ` iteration++;` and after executing the line, it equals `1`.  Seg fault??

Using an Xcode 12.4 External Build System, I'm able to build my controller.  However, I'm not able to debug it from Xcode because the controller can't find `libController.dylib` even though I've set WEBOTS\_HOME and DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH in the schema's environment.

Anyone on MacOS know how to fix this issue?



FIXED:

Instead of defining `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=${WEBOTS_HOME}/lib/controller`  (where `WEBOTS_HOME` was defined in the env entry above this one) I defined it as `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/Webots.app/lib/controller`.

##### TheGiant 06/21/2021 17:51:44
Hello, I was playing with USE/DEF, and found the hard way that I can't use it with Solid.

The doc state that we could use PROTO to do that, but I still need somewhere in it a Solid node, to be able to add physic and so on.

But Webots complain that even inside a PROTO node and I can't use use/def with those PROTO...

I had to modify the code to allows definition of use/def on (nested) solid node, but I was wondering if there is a proper solution to that.

##### mclzc 06/21/2021 18:10:28
I've answered in the Github issue `@Darko Lukić`, thanks.


I have a different question. My PROTO file, generated from a URDF, looks like this for the IMU-related section:

```
Robot {
    ...
    children [
        ...
        Solid {
            translation 0.000000 0.000000 0.075000
            rotation 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 0.000000
            children [
                Shape { ... }
                InertialUnit {
                    name "imu inertial"
                }
                Accelerometer {
                    name "imu accelerometer"
                }
                Gyro {
                    name "imu gyro"
                }
                Compass {
                    name "imu compass"
                }
            ]
            name "imu_link"
            boundingObject Box { ... }
        }
    ]
}
```



However, the `/imu` topic gives me `nan` accelerations and zero angular velocities. Only when I manually move the IMU devices outside of that `Solid` and make them first-level children of `Robot` in the PROTO file, is that I get actual `/imu` actual values.


The message with the default conversion looks like this:

```

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/21/2021 19:04:21
DEF/USE cannot and should not be used with Solid and joint nodes:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use?tab-language=ros#use-exceptions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use?tab-language=ros#use-exceptions)

DEF/USE nodes represents identical nodes and different instances of Solid node would never be identical.

So modifying the Webots code to support DEF/USE for Solid nodes is fundamentally wrong.

Instead, as suggested you should define your Solid in a PROTO file and add different instances of this PROTO (without using DEF/USE)

##### TheGiant 06/21/2021 19:20:52
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  Hmm... that make sense, i've just tweak the code to check if I didn't have issues anywhere else, so no worry 🙂 I will give another try to use solid in proto, but for the moment I had no luck (that why I'm here) , webots still complain :/ maybe need to sleep a bit before ! (I was thinking about def/use in different transform node, to get the solid at different position) . gonna try again, thank for the feedback !

You can copy and paste nodes from the UI to rearrange them, but then you have to save the changes to the WBT file otherwise you will always get the warning at load.

##### nap 06/23/2021 07:02:49
Thanks!  Bit clunky but worked.  Would be nice to drag/drop instead.

Hi, We want to do external control of an axis at 100+Hz. Currently we do that by just changing the node position without motor and joints. That works fine and the moves are smooth.

Now we are looking at the doing that the "normal" way using motor and joints. but the moves are hacking a lot even with really high velocity and -1 as acceleration. Is there any best practice on joint/motor setup for that? should we try to change joint position directly instead of sending position to motor?

In reality we send pos, acc and vel at 100+Hz to a PLC and the PLC does what it can follow that


also we can set velcoity to INFINITY in code but we found no way to set MAxVelcotiy for a motor than way so we get that warning: 



WARNING: DEF MyRobot1 RobotGrab1 (PROTO) > SliderJoint > Forks (PROTO) > HingeJoint > DEF Axis1 Axis1 (PROTO) > SliderJoint > DEF Axis2 Axis2 (PROTO) > SliderJoint > LinearMotor: The requested velocity inf exceeds 'maxVelocity' = 1e+10.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/23/2021 09:43:01
Some hints:

1. You should increase not only the maxVelocity, but also the maxTorque (or maxForce if it is a LinearMotor).

2. Using a large value for the velocity (e.g., = maxVelocity) instead of INFINITY should fix the warning.

3. I don't recommend changing the joint position directly as it bypasses the physics engine and will produce unstable results.

##### Johan2021 06/23/2021 11:21:50
Hi, I am controlling a robot modeled as a series of rigid segments connected by spring-damper balljoints including 3 rotational motors (.proto extract attached as file with a foot, ankle and body segment shown respectively). As shown in the (good) video, the robot crawls by bending the main body (by controlling the joints), and attaches itself to the surface by exerting a force on the foot segments (via a plugin). The foot segment joints are rigid and not controlled, while the ankle joints are generally flexible (torque = 0) and only controlled when the front foot should lift itself (this happens after a force is applied (lock) to the back foot and is taken away (unlock) from the front foot). Controlling the joint positions is done via the rotational motors.



The 2 videos show the intended (good) case, and an unintended (bad) one where the ankle position 'overflows' to 8.4 radians (the output from position sensors in the ankle joints). Both use exactly the same controller and plugin, but the bad video takes longer to contract and extend the body (via a controller parameter). Once this 'overflow' occurs, it also continues to show unintended behavior when lifting the feet again (i.e. when actively controlling the ankle joints). Is there anyone who may have a clue why or how this 'overflow' could happen in the ankle joints - or some clues on how to avoid this (best practices)?



It seems that the simulator is simulating physics correctly as there is no error message, so I wonder what interaction / physics step could cause this?

##### pyphais 06/23/2021 21:26:07
Hi, I'm trying to run a purely kinematics simulation using a robot that's set up in the way that should use a kinematics algorithm to compute the location of the vehicle (from this in the physics documentation: "The Robot nodes with a differential wheels configuration are a special case: they can move even if they don't have Physics nodes. That's because Webots uses a special kinematics algorithm for this kind of robots without Physics"). However, I am having some issues: firstly, the wheels spin backwards as the robot moves forwards, which makes no sense. Second, even if the wheels were spinning the correct way, the robot is not moving as it should when the left and right wheels are set to different speeds (ie when turning). I made a quick world to check what's going on and tested what happened when I set the left wheel motor speed to 1.5 and the right wheel motor speed to 1 (rad/s). With a wheel radius of 0.04m this should mean the left wheel is moving linearly 0.06m/s and the right is moving at 0.04 m/s. Using a position sensor on the wheels confirms that the motors do spin at 1 and 1.5 rad/s. However, putting a gps at the same position as the center of each wheel tells me the wheels are actually moving linearly 0.0580364 m/s instead of 0.6, and 0.0427993 m/s instead of 0.4, so the robot obviously does not turn on the arc I specify, the turning radius is much larger. What's going on? This 'special kinematics algorithm' seems to be flawed in my world and I can't find it anywhere to see why the vehicle won't move at the correct speed while turning, or why it's moving in the opposite direction that the wheels turn in. Any information or help would be appreciated, thank you.

##### mclzc 06/24/2021 03:32:47
Thank you, adding this to my URDF and letting urdf2proto process it added the missing `Physics` node to my PROTO. Now I see the IMU values.

Hii team, I have created assembly of robotic arm in Webots by importing CAD parts of arm, I have given hinge joints between different parts but I am not able to add motors in devices under hinge joint node.

 Any solution ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 06/24/2021 06:23:01
The assembly has to be part of a robot. You can only add devices to robots, not solid nodes

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 06/24/2021 07:07:08
Thanks for the update. We followed the hints over but the moves are still hacking much more than when moving the nodes 🤔 . What method does the ROS drivers use? They are also very keen into controlling motors at high frequencies

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 06/24/2021 07:10:03
They use the same. I suspect the problem is more in your model rather than in the control method. Can you send a simplified simulation at support@cyberbotics.com which demonstrates the problem? We will look into it and determine what's wrong.

##### It'sMe 06/24/2021 12:56:34
Ok 

Thanks

##### TheGiant 06/24/2021 13:21:20
Hello, I'm playing with the mass property of the physic node, and I'm confused about how the mass work : for instance : with a robot (a body 10kg and 4 legs 2kg each), I get 18kg. I'm using a node physic for each 5 Solid(4 leg, and the body), which is fine. But I need (is that right ?) a physic node on the robot node to get him moving, and I can't use a mass of zero in this one. I always end up putting a small negligible mass here (it's node pretty), but I don't understand the meaning of this mass. Did I miss anything ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/24/2021 13:26:09
In that case you should have 4 solids (4 legs) and the 5th one should be a Shape node (robot's body). Your robot's physics and bounding object should be related to the Shape node.



Check the `DEF_BODY` in the picture:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot#low-level-representation-of-the-4-wheeled-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot#low-level-representation-of-the-4-wheeled-robot)

##### TheGiant 06/24/2021 13:33:15
`@Darko Lukić` Thanks ! Never understood why I need a shape in that case before, that make more sense now. Is this true for nested Solid ? I mean for instance : if the leg (which is a solid) is composed of multiple part, the mass of the physic node of this solid is related to all the Shape in the "children" list. Could I put multiples Shape in here ? (i do think yes) (maybe in a group)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/24/2021 13:39:58
Less solids you have the better, it's easier for the physics engine and your simulation will run faster. Avoid adding a solid in a solid (if not necessary), you can always define multiple shapes inside a solid and multiple bounding objects.



P.S. There is an optimization in Webots to cope with unnecessary solid chains. It basically tries to merge two or more solids if possible before sending them to the physics engine.

##### TheGiant 06/24/2021 13:48:13
I agree, I'm here because of weird behavior and a "difficult" simulation (many solid, closed loop...) (performance not a big issue, for now), and I'm trying to understand what impact what... I'm using model coming from CAD, and nested assemblies are the norm. But I'm figuring out, as you said, that copying this pattern could cause trouble... Could I use nested Transform node, still ? 

Yes, read about that one, clever trick. However I will try to replace as much Solid as I can with Shape, it should help out.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/24/2021 13:49:46
> Could I use nested Transform node, still ?

I don't see why not 🙂

##### TheGiant 06/24/2021 13:50:14
About bounding box : I've a large part of my robot in which I don't care about collision, and I've figured out that I could use the inertia matrix computed by CAD, and use it there. Is it a good idea ?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/24/2021 13:53:19
You can either define the mass/density and a boundingObject (in which case Webots will compute the rest using this info) or just set the Physics node and additionally provide the `centerOfMass` and `inertiaMatrix` yourself. Either option is fine

##### TheGiant 06/24/2021 13:55:46
`@DDaniel` Yes I think I will go this route. And I think I've read that is I specify both (matrix and bounding box), the provided inertia matrix (and center of mass) will take over, but the bounding box will still be used for collisions

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 06/24/2021 13:57:22
I believe so yes

##### Majanao 06/25/2021 06:02:58
Hi all, month ago was working a simulation run by an external controller where I was able to do simulationReset() without killing the external controller. Now I'm using the same code for a different simulation and the controller stops after calling simulationReset(). Did Webots change or did I miss a simulation parameter which is defining this behaviour?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/25/2021 06:26:34
Normally it shouldn't reset the controllers. Which version do you use? See:

Hi Darko, we were using 2020b earlier and 2021a now. 

I just figured out, that it is the robot model, not the code. I imported our old protos model and it works. The new one doesn't. It was created with URDF2Webots. I tried to copy all the setup parameters from the old protos into the new one, but that doesn't work either.

I am not sure if understand the problem. The simulationReset() works with the old PROTOs, but not with the PROTO generated with urdf2webots?

##### Majanao 06/25/2021 07:38:16
I have to admit, that this is a weird issue. But that seems to be the case. The only difference between both versions is the proto model and the one is working, the other one (generated with URDF2Webots) doesn't.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/25/2021 07:41:03
If you put both PROTOs in the same simulation and you reset it simulationReset() than one controller is reset, while the other is running? Can you send us the minimum example to reproduce it?

##### Majanao 06/25/2021 07:41:53

##### Jan Weber 06/25/2021 08:37:25
Hello,

I am currently working on a cosimulation between Webots and a human crowd simulator. The idea is to move crowds of pedestrians realistically in Webots. This works quite well so far. Since the crowd simulator (Menge crowd simulator) also needs a map of the world, I am looking for a way to export a 2D map of the obstacles from the Webots world.

My approach so far is to export to VRML, convert it to STL and slice it. However, this seems quite complex to me. Does anyone have a better idea?



Many greetings

Jan Weber

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/25/2021 08:44:54
Maybe you can put a range finder at a very high altitude pointing to the ground (with a high value for the focal length). Then you should be able to use a simple thresholding, everything above the threshold is an obstacle.



That is one idea. Maybe somebody else has a better idea?

##### Jan Weber 06/25/2021 08:57:30
Thank you! That's a good idea and I'll give it a try. However, this approach also recognises objects as obstacles under which pedestrians can pass.

Hi, we are trying to implement connectors to move the pallet together with the arm in the gif. At this point the connectors locks together, but when moving the arm, the pallet stays still. It also loses its "solidness" and the arm is able to move through it. The same happens when trying on a standard solid box with a connector. We have tried both symmetrical and active/passive connectors. Physics is enabled on both of the connectors parentnode, and mass defined. 

On the right side of the gif is values from the connector on the moving arm.

Do anyone have any ideas what could be the problem?

##### Annan 06/30/2021 08:58:55
Hello,  I have a question: is it possible to  train the PPO in multiprocess model with webots. Which means that  I will use one external controller(agent) to collect datas in several webots instantiation. I can train the ppo in one webots simulation and want to speed it up by data parallelism


I find some hints from the discord archive, but didn't understand very well.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/30/2021 09:10:23
You can spawn multiple Webots simulations and then attach an external controller to each of them

##### Annan 06/30/2021 09:13:52
yes, but for each Webots simulations, it need at least one external controller, which means training several agent simutaneously. I hope to train one agent with multiple Webots simulations to collect data.


Luftwaffel have shared a demo in this link:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C4ICDz30GjKs5PkuYxNW8\_mFCcxEJlPs/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C4ICDz30GjKs5PkuYxNW8_mFCcxEJlPs/view?usp=sharing), but I am not sure this demo trains four agent or just one agent. Would you please give me more details

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/30/2021 09:17:48
It trains one agent, but it collects an experience from multiple simulations


If you use baselines, there is the `SubprocVecEnv` module which allows interaction with multiple agents running in different processes

##### Annan 06/30/2021 09:30:00
Amazing work! Thank you very much. I use stablebaselines3, it  aslo has the SubprocVecEnv, but I don't know how to make each simulation and external controller become consistent. Should I launch the webots in my gym-env class and give unique PID to WEBOTS\_PID variable, ................or just wrapper  my custom env into SubprocVecEnv, then stablebaselines3 will do the other things automaticly?


I try to use Webots to train a humanoid with 24 DoF, the actions space is very high, so that multiprocessing is very important for me

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 06/30/2021 09:34:24
You have to assign a controller to the correct Webots instance either with  `WEBOTS_PID` or `WEBOTS_TMPDIR`.


Something like this:

```py
def make_env(unique_id):
    os.environ['WEBOTS_TMPDIR'] = os.path.join('/tmp', unique_id)
    subprocess.call(['webots'])
    supervisor = Supervisor()
    env = MyWebotsEnv(supervisor)
    return env

env = SubprocVecEnv([lambda: make_env(i) for i in range(n_jobs)])
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env)
model.learn()
```

##### Annan 06/30/2021 09:39:06
Thank you very much for the kind help,  I will try it.  👍 👍


Thank you again, these are really helpful😃

##### Johan2021 06/30/2021 11:26:52
Hi, I am using a ballJoint with 3 rotational motors as shown in the extract, to control a robot joint. The jointParameters nodes specify the axes of rotation ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters?tab-language=python)). When I spawn the model with a different orientation (either inside the proto file or the wbt file), these axes seem to be in **absolute** coordinates, and not w.r.t. the body frame. While if the robot is spawned with zero rotation, the axes remain expressed w.r.t. the body frame while the robot is moving and changing its global orientation. Is this intended or is there a way to express the axes in relative coordinates?

##### James Le Poidevin 06/30/2021 12:14:29
Hello, I'm having a hard time converting a C controller to python. While converting these lines :

```
  // Robot init for webots
  wb_robot_init();

  // Activate keyboard input
  wb_keyboard_enable(TIME_STEP);

  // get the root children field
  const WbNodeRef root_node = wb_supervisor_node_get_root();
  const WbFieldRef root_children_field = wb_supervisor_node_get_field(root_node, "children");


  // Get the droneE and droneA node using the supervisor
  droneE = wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def("Drone");
  droneA = wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def("DroneA");

  // Enable the camera
  camera = wb_robot_get_device("camera1");
  wb_camera_enable(camera, 64);
```

I have 2 robots in the simulation and both are nearly identical. I want to get the robot node for DroneA and activate the camera, in C it works fine but i can't get it to work in python. Do you have any idea how to use the supervisor to activate cameras and move motors ?

Precision: Using Supervisor and controller on DroneA

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/30/2021 12:27:07
`@James Le Poidevin` You can activate the camera for DroneA only from the controller of DroneA using the Camera API.

This is exactly the same independently if using C or Python controller.

##### James Le Poidevin 06/30/2021 12:29:25
```
# create the Supervisor instance.
supervisor = Supervisor()

DroneE = supervisor.getFromDef("Drone")
DroneA = supervisor.getFromDef("DroneA")
    
cameraPitch = DroneA.getDevice("camera pitch")
cameraPitch.setPosition(float('+inf'))
cameraPitch.setVelocity(0)
```

This is for the motors but it's the same problem.

This is the error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "drone_ally_defense.py", line 22, in <module>
    cameraPitch = DroneA.getDevice("camera pitch")
  File "/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38/controller.py", line 1756, in <lambda>
    __getattr__ = lambda self, name: _swig_getattr(self, Node, name)
  File "/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/python38/controller.py", line 96, in _swig_getattr
    raise AttributeError("'%s' object has no attribute '%s'" % (class_type.__name__, name))
AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'getDevice'
```

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 06/30/2021 12:32:56
Ok. So let me better explain.

First, you can activate the camera only if the `DroneA.controller` is set to run this supervisor controller.

Then, the `getDevice` method is part of the `Robot` class and not the `Node` class. This means that you should call `supervisor.getDevice("camera pitch")`.

##### James Le Poidevin 06/30/2021 12:35:11
Thank you, It works now 👍

##### AloneLeader 06/30/2021 19:01:09
Is there anyone who knows how to make a pulley and rope system


I cant figure it out which joint should i use

## July

##### Johan2021 07/01/2021 10:22:01
if it is just a planar rope-pulley case, normal hingeJoints are simple and sufficient to connect a series of smaller rigid segments, but if you would move or exert force in multiple directions, you should use a ballJoint - for both cases, you can model cord extension/tension using the spring/damper fields of the joint nodes. For interaction with the pulley you should modify the contact properties between rope and pulley - hope that helps, but I am no expert

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 07/01/2021 11:25:38
Axes should always remain expressed in local coordinates w.r.t to parent node.

Could you provide the complete PROTO model of the robot?

You are moving the joint using the motors and not directly changing the JointParameter position, is it correct?


`@AloneLeader` additionally you can find here a simple example of rope simulation.


`@Johan2021` I can reproduce the issue with ball joint. This is clearly a bug. We will inspect and fix it.

##### Johan2021 07/01/2021 12:40:50
That is correct

##### Batrox 07/01/2021 16:27:06
is ist normal that the simulation speed varies? because i set up a robot with a leg that is moving in constant speed most of the time (and hitting the ground) but every 10 seconds it rotates extremely fast for about half a second

##### jasper [Moderator] 07/01/2021 19:56:49
simulation speed depends on many factors such as how many collisions need to be calculated and how complex the objects colliding are. It can therefore vary quite a bit depending on whats going on

##### Batrox 07/01/2021 19:57:38
alright that's good to know, thanks

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/02/2021 06:17:06
`@GKiggz` Hi, like the message says, you're using functions in your controller that in the future will no longer be supported and although it's still working for now, you should consider using the new ones. As for python, you might already have a higher version of it installed, if on Linux you probably already have python3 in which case you can set that as the default python command in the preferences to make the message disappear. If not, you'll need to install a newer version first and then do it.

##### GKiggz 07/02/2021 12:54:02
how do I know what the "new" functions are that I should use? I should also mention that when my friend uses the exact same code, he has no problem

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/02/2021 13:49:45
it's written in the message 🙂 Replace the calls of `robot.getMotor` with `robot.getDevice`. He doesn't have the messages probably because he's using a older version of webots.

##### GKiggz 07/02/2021 13:51:02
Thank you! I'll make sure to try it. (I will probably come back with questions because I started using webots 2 days ago)


hi, even when I do robot.getDevice, the same error message comes up, and the code runs the exact same thing


I can literally delete the code and save it and press run and it will do the exact same thing

##### KC 07/07/2021 08:24:52
Hi. I'm simulating a game of robot soccer and I'm using ROS through webots\_ros package for the robot controllers. The whole simulation is working fine, just the thing is that I can't reset the simulation once a goal is scored as it would restart the robot and camera services and break the link between ROS nodes and webots. I need to restart all my image processing nodes manually after resetting. 

So, I was looking to build a python script which would detect whether the goal is scored and will just pull the robots and the ball to their initial positions without resetting the environment and the game will continue. Is there a way I can do that through a ROS node? I'm aware that it can be done using supervisor API but that would require a webots robot controller as far as I know.  Any help on this would be great

##### jasper [Moderator] 07/07/2021 09:13:00
You can simply add a "fake" robot node and make it a supervisor controller. Otherwise you could make the ball a robot node with a GPS sensor and let itself publish it a goal was scored. In the second option resetting is not really possible though

##### KC 07/07/2021 15:00:15

Hello,

Is there any way to "lock" a Joint temporary using controller ? Because sometime two parts can't and shouldn't move on relatively to the other, whatever the force on the Joint. I've succeed to do this with Connectors on each part linked by the Joint, but it's not a very elegant solution, nor very practical, when the number of Joint increase....

Do the ros controller automatically publish all the sensor nodes?

##### jasper [Moderator] 07/07/2021 15:27:25
You could try adding a break to the joints [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/brake](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/brake)

##### TheGiant 07/07/2021 15:31:53
Yes, but afaik, it will only add damping to the Joint (or Could I specify and "infinite" damping ?). And that not enough, because it will not forbid the part to slowly drift away... (at low speed, F = -Bv, which is too small to keep part in place, when speed is very low) Furthermore, It would be nice to help out the physic solver by removing this Joint from the simulation, and basically "stuck" the two part one onto each other.

Hi, it should be possible to change the road appearance, do you get an error or something when deleting the `Asphalt` node? What version of webots are you using?

##### yanan 07/08/2021 10:02:31
Hi Daniel, I am using the Webots R2021a. actually, there is no option to change the appearance of the road within the appearance Asphalt

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/08/2021 10:08:55
The asphalt appearance is predefined. If you want a custom appearance, right-click and delete it. In its place you can add a new appearance which you can customise.

##### scott.nortman 07/08/2021 13:17:40
`@Darko Lukić` `@Olivier Michel` Thank you, that fixed the issue!  Where is this documented?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/08/2021 14:21:07
Here:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/API-Devices#class-webots\_ros2\_coredevicessensor\_devicesensordevicenode-device\_key-wb\_device-paramsnone](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/API-Devices#class-webots_ros2_coredevicessensor_devicesensordevicenode-device_key-wb_device-paramsnone)



But it should work without the parameter as well. The cameras are disabled by default (an optimization technique). The cameras are enabled only if the number of subscribers is greater than 0 or the `always_publish` parameter is set to true.



For some reason, your camera subscribers are not counted in the ROS 2 API. QoS may affected it. Have you tried subscribing to cameras from RViz2 (there you can control QoS)?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 07/09/2021 07:18:46
You should simply add a Recognition node ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition)) to your Camera ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera)) device, in the `recognition` field.

##### FunkyPants 07/09/2021 09:55:03
Hey, I'm pretty new to Webots, in my robot, when I use a Ball Joint with an initial position, when I reset the simulation the endpoints positions and rotations reset to weird values

##### scott.nortman 07/09/2021 12:29:33
`@Olivier Michel` Thank you, will do.  Even if I do not need to use the built-in recongnition, it is suggested tht I add the node?

##### Affonso 07/09/2021 12:31:19
Hey, have any API to apply to use ESP32 libraries like esp now?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 07/09/2021 12:32:11
No, if you don't use it, no need to add the node.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/09/2021 14:08:47
`@FunkyPants` did you change the initial position through the interface before saving or did you manually set it by editing the world file?

##### FunkyPants 07/09/2021 14:10:46
I changed it through the interface, right now I found that by setting it to default and changing manually in the controller seems to work


However when I try to set the initial position of the hinge nodes on the interface the children nodes end up in weird positions after I reset


It only happens when I have more than one hinge set to non zero on the ball joint

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/09/2021 14:16:49
can you provide the world file you're using? (ideally, remove everything except what is causing the issue)

##### FunkyPants 07/09/2021 14:29:37

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/09/2021 15:03:03
Yes you're right, I can reproduce it as well. The resetting of the `BallJoint` is buggy. We'll look into it, thank you

##### FunkyPants 07/09/2021 23:47:06
Thanks for looking into it, any suggestions on what I should do in the meantime or is the controller thing the best thing I could do

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 07/12/2021 08:15:33
The transfer to the real robot was implemented for the Khepera I robot and not Khepera IV. So currently Webots doesn't provide out of the box transfer system for the Khepera IV robot.


But you can write your own remote control plugin to communicate with the real robot:

##### aa-234 07/12/2021 12:10:04
Hi,

I am trying to make a tic-tac-toe game in Webots.



I have 2 robot one that draw circle and the others draw crosses using the device "pen".



I need them to recognise when the other robot draws something, but the camera recognition seems to work only on solid.



Is there a way to make the camera recognise drawings ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 07/12/2021 12:13:43
Hi, not with the Camera Recognition functionality.

In this case you should implement a vision algorithm that analyzes the camera image and extracts the drawings.

##### aa-234 07/12/2021 12:17:26
Thanks I will try that method

##### iiiiiian 07/12/2021 13:15:10
Recently, I met a problem. I ran webots 2019b in Ubuntu1604, and it often blocks. I have to close it forced. And I can't reopen it again. When I saw top, I found Xorg uses 100% cpu. When I kill Xorg, I can reopen Xorg. How can I solve this problem.

##### Julius 07/12/2021 17:26:38
Hi!

I have a robot containing a hingejoint (y-axis) -> solid endpoint -> sliderjoint (y-axis) -> solid endpoint -> sliderjoint (x-axis) -> solid endpoint. Physics is enabled on all solids. Im running into a problem where turning the hingejoint at 2π max velocity that the last solid endpoint (the one on the sliderjoint across the x-axis) shoots out. it seems out it is affected by a centrifugal force which results in this movement. I have observed that increasing the mass or the distance between the endpoint and the hingejoint worsens this problem, which build in to that this is a result of a centrifugal force as well.

Do somebody have an idea what could help in this situation?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/12/2021 22:57:35
`@Julius` to test your hypothesis, you could set the mass of the last solid to 0. Also you can try to increase the maxForce


max force of theslider joint that is


`@iiiiiian` update to the newest version of webots. You are using a very old version


and it sounds like you dont have gpu drivers installed. Xorg doing the graphics on cpu, which is bad

##### scott.nortman 07/13/2021 00:45:14
Is there a way to programmatically control the position and orientation of a camera sensor?  For example, is there a .setRotation() or a setTranslation() method?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/13/2021 00:45:50
there is, but it can mess with physics


what exactly do you want to do?


Do you just want to have a "standalone" camera recording a scene, or is it actually attached to a real robot? If it is the latter, I would strongly advice against it


But if you just want to move a camera around, add an empty Robot node to the scene and add the camera as its child. Then use the supervisor functionality to move the robot's base coordinates and orientation [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

##### Axel M 07/15/2021 06:30:34
Hi, I'm trying to setup a ROS 2 custom driver for my robot.

I have previous experience doing so with ROS 1, where I created a ROS1 node from scratch, using the Webots library directly to make the bridge.



For ROS2, I stumbled upon [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/) which I'm not exactly sure about the role it's fulfilling. 



The "Universal launcher" seems to be the equivalent of the previous "ros1 controller", exposing topics / service automatically based on the loaded robot, which i'm not interested in.

In the custom driver section of the documentation, example is shown written in Python. I've seen the "WebotsNode" class also existing in C++ : can it be used to write a driver in C++ instead of Python ?



Finally, what does"WebotsNode" approach bring compared to use the plain Webots library in a custom ROS2 node ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/15/2021 06:55:12
The webots\_ros2 package uses Python to create a ROS 2 interface out of a Webots robot model. The C++ you saw suppose to replace the Python based interface.



You can implement the ROS 2 interface as you started, no problem there. However, the webots\_ros2 package will simply help you with a few things:

- it automatically creates topics for common sensors and actuators (we were careful to optimize this and to follow ROS 2 conventions),

- it integrates ros2\_control (C++ version only),

- it provides joint\_state\_publisher, trajectory\_follower, and differential\_drive,

- it provides a convenient way to launch the simulation from a launch file (there is a custom action for that, and it also finds the Webots installation),

- it integrates urdf2webots as a ROS 2 node,

- it publishes the ROS 2 clock,

- it automatically installs Webots if not present (useful when sharing a ROS 2 application).



Besides, there are a lot of examples.



WebotsNode implements initiates the creation of ROS 2 interface. You can use it to configure or extend the ROS 2 interface.

##### Axel M 07/15/2021 07:49:34
Thanks `@Darko Lukić` 🙂



I tried to create a package which depends on `webots_ros2`, however CMake fails to resolve the dependency.

Looking at potential examples, I found `webots_ros2_control` which depends on `webots_ros2_driver` (where the WebotsNode.cpp lives), but I couldn't depend on this package either, CMake fails to resolve it. In addition, `ros2 pkg list | grep webots` gives me the following : 



> webots\_ros2

> webots\_ros2\_abb

> webots\_ros2\_core

> webots\_ros2\_demos

> webots\_ros2\_epuck

> webots\_ros2\_examples

> webots\_ros2\_tiago

> webots\_ros2\_turtlebot

> webots\_ros2\_tutorials

> webots\_ros2\_universal\_robot

> webots\_ros2\_ur\_e\_description



I then tried to depend on `webots_ros2_core` but still no success.


For reference, here is my CMakeLists.txt :


```cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
project(jrb_webots)

if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX OR CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang")
  add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic)
endif()

# find dependencies

find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
find_package(webots_ros2_core REQUIRED)


add_executable(driver_node src/driver_node.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(driver_node rclcpp webots_ros2_core)

install(TARGETS

And the CMake error :

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/15/2021 08:36:29
The `webots_ros2_core` is a Python package, so you cannot depend on it in a CMake file. The `webots_ros2_driver` is not released yet, you have to compile the package from source (and source it).

How can I get current world title, info etc., using `supervisor`?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 07/19/2021 06:20:44
With the Supervisor API you can first get the WorldInfo node and then get the specific field of the node.

You can find an example here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)


To complete the answer of `@DrVoodoo`, please find here the documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=ros#wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_objects](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=ros#wb_camera_recognition_get_objects)

The API function to get the Camera Recognition Objects is now returning the `RecognitionObjects` message.

##### SeanLuTW 07/19/2021 06:37:02
Thanks! For Python, it would be `supervisor.getRoot().getField('children').getMFNode(0).getField('title').getSFString()`

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 07/19/2021 07:32:20
`@Alejandro Naranjo` you can get a depth image and then convert to a point cloud

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/20/2021 06:21:22
`@johnnycannoli` Hi, you can create closed mechanical loops using SolidReferences [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference). The closest thing to a delta robot currently available in the sample library is the Stewart platform [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-demos#stewart\_platform-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-demos#stewart_platform-wbt), you can inspire yourself from it.

##### ClBaze 07/20/2021 14:04:07
Hello, I've made a robot composed of 3 hingejoints with the last joint holding a Solid which has a gyroscope and an accelerometer.

I've only set the physics field of the Solid.

The accelerometer outputs data but the gyro doesn't.

Why is that ?


(I mean the gyro always return 0 0 0)


All the parents should have Physics ?

Hi, I'm trying to create a bunch of boxes for a robot to move around. Each box has an emitter in it which repeatedly sends out a fixed message so it can be located. Is there a way I can control all the box's emitters from a single supervisor?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/20/2021 16:50:01
No, you cannot access devices in another robot

##### Funnydeth 07/20/2021 16:51:21
Ok, thanks. I assume you couldn't have all the boxes be in the same robot but be able to move independently of each other?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/20/2021 16:53:13
Maybe you can attach all of them to the robot using two linear actuators (per box)

##### Funnydeth 07/20/2021 16:53:49
Thanks for your help I'll have a look into that

##### johnnycannoli 07/20/2021 22:36:31
I'm having trouble with my SolidReferences. When I add it to my BallJoint, the only thing it does is act as an attachment to the static world. I have tried setting the StaticReference to any Solid in my design and it only ever acts as an attachment to the world. I have made sure that my Solids all have a physics Node. Do I have any options for more verbose output so I can debug further?

I want to transform the pointcloud coordinates to robot frame for pick and place, does Webots has any way to get the transforms? how do I go about it?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 07/21/2021 06:37:55
Yes, you should try to add the Physics node to the upper `Solid` nodes in the `Joint.endPoint` fields.

Here you can find a similar example: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#gyro-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#gyro-wbt)

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/21/2021 06:56:39
You have to do it manually. But it should be one line of Python code, something like `tranformed_pc = transform_matrix @ pc`, assuming that `pc` is shaped as a 4xN matrix (`N` number of points). You can obtain a transformation matrix between two Webots nodes using the `wb_supervisor_node_get_pose` function:

Hi all, I am implementing a couple of distance (laser) sensors as shown in the picture. It does however seem that the distance returned does not seem to be very accurate. The robot is 10cm long only and the values shown are for all 5 sensors - is there a way to improve this? The relation between signal and actual distance in meters is y = 10/x. The values of the robot in the picture are shown as last in the console (preceded by nr. 2). Decreasing the 'aperture' or increasing 'lineScale' does not help.



```DistanceSensor {
   translation 0.0 0.0105 -0.002
   rotation 0 0 1 1.5708
   type "laser"
   name "dist_1"
   aperture 0.0005
   #map as y = 10/x
   lookupTable [ 0.001 10000 0,
                 0.01 1000 0,
                 0.10 100 0,

Guys we want to simulate a cave mapping system using Webots. So we are thinking of using a lidar sensor plus stereo imaging to create a 3D map. Are there any good tutorials, github repositaries about this? (The sample on lidar in the webots reference section only covers a 2d mapping part. )

##### Venkat 07/21/2021 19:19:27
I have robot with endeffector for a pick and place task. I want the gripper to orient itself perpendicular to the object being grasped. I used the inverse kinematic solver as in the sample ABB code: ikResults = armChain.inverse\_kinematics([x, y, z], max\_iter=IKPY\_MAX\_ITERATIONS, initial\_position=initial\_position),  From documentation, I see that the target orientation be set using : inverse\_kinematics(self, target\_position=None, target\_orientation=None, orientation\_mode=None, **kwargs). I tried giving target\_orientation as numpy.array consisting of angles in [x,y,z]. I tried with rad and degrees. But I dont see any change in gripper orientation. Do I miss something, that is necessary to make the orientation work?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/21/2021 22:48:49
ikpy is not very good


you should use a ikfast solver


what operating system are you on?


`@Venkat`  extract this project. Go into "./controllers/inverse\_kinematics\_pyikfast/irb4600\_solver" and run `pip install .`

Then open the world. It should do 10s of a velocity control loop. After that you can move the TARGET sphere and the arm will move to the exact position and orientation of the sphere. Let me know if that works or you have some issues still

you can get the quaternion


oh you probably want to get the noise


hmmm googling a bit it seems I dont fully understand covariance. <@&568329906048598039> perhaps one of you can take a look. Perhaps that is a missing feature.

I applied your distance settings to a sample world and I don't see any issue with the measurements precision. Could you please share a simple world where this is reproducible?


A simple method to compute the covariance for the IMU sensor could be to use the noise: `(InertialUnit.noise)^2`

`@Venkat` move the sphere around, it has to be a reachable position. Also the orientation matters. I believe i aligns the end effektor with the x-axis ofthe sphere


you can also pm me and we can have a detailed look together

##### Sir 07/24/2021 03:11:20
Hi, is it possible to change set in some way the coordinate system for the supervisor get\_orientation? 

I'm trying to use the Supervisor to get the position and orientation of a robot using ROS. I've set the world coordinates on ENU. Using an Inertial Unit I got it to work fine when setting it with the axis as the wiki says they should be for ENU. However, when using the supervisor get\_orientation service it seems to return the orientation as the Inertial Unit would if it was set up in the NUE way. 

Is there something I should've set to change the world orientation coordinate system or something?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/26/2021 14:10:53
Yes, but you still need Webots to run in backend as the physics engine and controller support are not ported to the web. See:

In that case, maybe your robot is not FLU?

Pioneer 3DX is not FLU. This is not possible to change by changing the coordinateSystem. The only way is to change the PROTO.


Pioneer AT is converted to FLU in R2021b, maybe it can be substitute for Pioneer 3DX. We are working on converting all PROTOs to FLU and all worlds to ENU:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/3073](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/3073)

##### Joro 07/27/2021 01:23:11
i know you use the same shape of the appereance for the bounding box to generate a simulation more realistic but i think thats too much for webots, try using a simplified bounding box, like a box (parallelepiped)


in other case, create another mesh with the same surface of the case you show above, but without the inside details

Hi, you can look at the sample world `e-puck_line_demo.wbt` (`file > open sample world`)


`@Amer` How did you import the shape and what format? It could be that the number of triangles is excessive (in which case you can decimate it using a software like Blender for instance) or that the timestep is too high. If you click on the `geometry` field normally it should show you the number of triangles

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/27/2021 06:32:33
Did you build the Python library in the host machine or Docker?

##### Azer Babaev [Starkit, TC] 07/27/2021 08:26:49
I move robot model and and controller software from Coppelia to Webots. In Coppelia there are 2 types of timesteps: physics engine timestep which is usually 5 ms and simulation timestep which was used to be 20ms for my model. Means controller software generates servo states for 20ms steps. In Webots world I find just basicTimeStep. When I set it to 20ms I see non-realistic behavior of model. During simulation there appear Warnings with recommendations to make model less complex or to reduce basicTimeStep of world. With reduced basicTimeStep behavior of model more realistic. Is there opportunity to separate physics engine timestep from simulator timestep? Real robot works with 20 ms frames of servo controller.

##### Amer 07/27/2021 08:29:32
I exported the shape from Inventor CAD using STL format.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 07/27/2021 08:29:38
Yes the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` corresponds to the physics time step, it should be set to a low value (e.g., 8 ms). The argument of the `webots_step()` API function is the control time step which should be a multiple of the physics time step, e.g., 16, 24, 32, etc.

##### Amer 07/27/2021 08:30:21
then imported into webots straightforward.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/27/2021 08:36:54
`@Amer` how many triangles is it comprised of? (triangle count)

Thank you!

##### Amer 07/27/2021 08:53:41
it says 0 when i tried to use it as a mesh.


but i didnt use mesh at all


when i imported it it was converted to a solid file with shape and indexedfaceset geometry


and then i defined it with a name and used it here

sorry for uploading many pics


i cant explain properly


should i be using mesh for my geometry from now on? is it like better?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/27/2021 09:05:04
Since you have an STL, it makes more sense to insert it into a Mesh node. Can you try again? `Shape > geometry > add Mesh node > double-click url > select the STL`

##### Amer 07/27/2021 09:05:22
yes! i tried just now


it seems better


let me show u

though i have to separate the wheels from the case


but it seems better


ill try to use this in the simulation and hopefully it works


thanks alot

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/27/2021 09:08:45
either way, I wouldn't use the STL for the boundingObject, even less so if the triangle count is fairly high  (tens of thousands), you should instead approximate the shape using base nodes like cylinders, boxes etc. Using the STL might lead to instabilities

##### Amer 07/27/2021 09:09:30
it does indeed lead to some instabilities.


its kind of a complex shape its hard to approxiamte with base nodes


but ill have to make it work somehow


appreciate the help

##### Johan2021 07/27/2021 10:53:23

Hi `@DDaniel`,   I have exported my robot in x3d format, and rendering it in the browser. How can I manipulate robot? I mean is there any possibility to change position of robot elements just in browser as 3d object?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/27/2021 14:01:51
I am not sure. It is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8 without venv. Maybe try that configuration?

##### tabousoud 07/27/2021 14:14:29
My machine is running Linux Mint 20.1 (based on Ubuntu 20.04), and the conda environment uses Python 3.8.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/27/2021 14:24:11
`@Iskender` Hi, if you just exported it as an animation then no, you can't edit the scene from the browser. If instead you're streaming the webots window, then the changes you do on the webots side will also occur in the browser stream

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/27/2021 20:06:30
Hi, this error is caused due to the fact, that the kinova arms require LAPACK on the system for the solver to work


I can dig a bit to try and dig it up. BTW, I already converted the kinova arms [https://github.com/cyberbotics/community-projects/tree/master/robots/kinova/protos](https://github.com/cyberbotics/community-projects/tree/master/robots/kinova/protos)

##### tabousoud 07/27/2021 20:24:09
Hi `@Simon Steinmann` , thanks for the info. I've been using your proto as well as one I created myself of the 7DoF model for my project. Please let me know if you find anything about linking LAPACK. I have it in the environment but don't know if it's an issue of the linker needing to find it when compiling the package or if there's something else I need to do to get it to work.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 07/27/2021 20:24:28
perhaps try this [https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/27/install-lapack-and-blas-on-linux-based-systems/](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/27/install-lapack-and-blas-on-linux-based-systems/)


lapack can be a pain in the ass and I never got it to work on windows


and 7DOF does not work with ikfast


only when deactivating one link

##### tiborbs1 07/28/2021 08:28:39
Hi, I am woking on a multi-robot simulation using the new standard ROS controller. Is it possible to expose the robot\_description param in its own namespace, so that /robot\_description becomes /robot1/robot\_description? Secondly, is it possible to spawn the controller manager  (which spawns when using the --use-ros-control) in the robot's namespace, so that we have one controller manager for each robot (example: /robot1/controller\_manager, /robot2/controller\_manager, etc.)?

##### Iskender 07/28/2021 08:49:32
Hi `@Darko Lukić`, thanks for the previous answer, I have few more questions: 

1) How can I stream telemetry from robot to browser? would be cool to get some links to doc or something similar to have guidance. 

2) Just to confirm, as Daniel Dias responded, If we stream our robot to browser, all movements will be replicated in browser as well? is that correct?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 07/28/2021 09:03:53
At the moment it is not possible. The following parts have to be changed:

- [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ed42ce721f4db6cf9c219c4beb92af9bfddc6e98/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L474](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ed42ce721f4db6cf9c219c4beb92af9bfddc6e98/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L474)

- [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ed42ce721f4db6cf9c219c4beb92af9bfddc6e98/projects/default/controllers/ros/highlevel/RosControl.cpp#L23](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ed42ce721f4db6cf9c219c4beb92af9bfddc6e98/projects/default/controllers/ros/highlevel/RosControl.cpp#L23)

If you download the Webots tarball you can change everything without recompiling Webots. Just go to `projects/default/controllers/ros`, `export ROS_DISTRO=noetic`, and run `make`. P.S. Please contribute the solution 🙂



Alternatively, you can run the standard `ros` controller as an external controller. In that case you can use the standard ROS mechanism for namespaces and remapping.


1) You have to implement the telemetry mechanism by yourself. It can be a simple WebSocket server running as a robot controller.

2) Yes

##### Iskender 07/28/2021 09:15:10
`@Darko Lukić` Just to clarify, regarding the second question, I meant will it be replicated in browser as x3d object (all movements, etc.)? Because we need to stream to browser video itself using websocket, and have 

 window with 3d ojects replicating all robot movements as well. Thanks in advance!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/28/2021 09:37:58
`@Iskender` I'm not sure I understand, but the easiest way would be for you to simply test it:

1. Launch webots as: `webots --stream` and open your world

2. navigate to `webots/resources/web/streaming_viewer` and open the `.html` and click `connect`

3. If you pause/play and or delete objects on the webots side, the stream also updates accordingly.

##### Alejandro Naranjo 07/28/2021 14:27:07
that's exactly what I used, but when I view it in rviz it comes out as a black image.

You have to use sockets


You can use the Display node:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display)



There is a `wb_display_attach_camera` function that allows you attach the camera stream. Then, you can use the display to draw over it.


Yes, you can use the Supervisor API:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)



You will need the `wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def` to get the Viewpoint node, the `wb_supervisor_node_get_field` function to get the translation and rotation fields, and the `wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f/wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_rotation` to set the rotation and translation.

##### n33r4j 07/29/2021 09:55:36
The string that would need to be passed to `wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def` to get the Viewpoint node is just "Viewpoint" right? Or is this supposed to be some other string?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 07/29/2021 09:59:01
`@n33r4j` no, you need to give it a DEF in the world file: for instance, `DEF MY_ALIAS Viewpoint { ...` and then get it by `node = wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def("MY_ALIAS")`

Thanks. I was able to figure out how to move the Viewpoint via the controller. Just a bit difficult to move the camera along the surface of a sphere always looking at the origin using Axis-Angle. Might use quaternions.

Hello everyone


I am trying to use naoqisim on webots R2021a


it *almost* works


The arms are not budging at all, although all the other motors are


I am using it on arch linux if that's any help


This is it doing the tai chi dance, alll motors operational excepts the arms for some reason

Hi, I am trying to simulate a Realsense D435 stero camera (I only need the stereo images).  My tracking code works with the real camera, but I am getting strange values when simulating a scence with webots.  One of the possible issues may be related to the setting I use for the disparity calculation; for the realsense camera, I know the pixel pitch is 3um, so I can determine the length of a feature projection on the imager, but how will this work with webots, since there is no imager and corresponding pixel pitch.  Any feedback welcome...

Hi, can I get current world file name using `Supervisor`?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/02/2021 06:02:36
Hi, you can get it using the `wb_robot_get_world_path` function:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_world\_path](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_world_path)


Hi, I would suggest you to take a look at the  `floating_geometries.wbt` sample simulation. This could probably help you:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#floating\_geometries-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#floating_geometries-wbt)


To segment just an object, you could edit your world and empty the `recognitionColors` field of all the other solid you are not interested in.

This way the segmentation image will only contain your custom robot.

The,n, if you set the `recognitionColors` of your robot to white, you will get a binary mask.


You should calibrate your robot and adjust not only the mass but also the position of the center of mass.

If the robot is made by different solid parts, it may be needed to calibrate the mass and center of mass for all of them.

##### Thiago Costa 08/02/2021 12:37:41
hello everyone,

I need to implement the Teaching & Playback technique on a robot developed by a study group, programmed in C language. It has two encoders and 3 distance sensors. I need suggestions to implement the Playback part. I saw on the cyberbotics website about the "motion.h" library, but I couldn't understand its correct functioning. Could someone explain better how to implement it?

##### viorel\_gheorghe 08/02/2021 15:41:43
Hi there! There's needed some simulations of a mobile robot on surfaces with different friction coefficient. I set 'default' material on wheels and the white plane and on the gray plane 'low\_friction' material and 'default'. It'k ok like that or some more materials have to be added. Thanks in advance!

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 08/02/2021 15:44:08
That should be sufficient.

##### viorel\_gheorghe 08/02/2021 15:47:12
`@Olivier Michel` thank you!


If I may use more of your knowledge: I use supervisor node to see the position/orientation of the robot, but the robot gets up & down +-0.5mm (visually sinks more). Can I correct this?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 08/02/2021 15:54:01
Maybe using the ERP/CFM parameters (or softERP, softCFM).

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/02/2021 15:57:02
`@viorel_gheorghe` Also lowering the timestep can reduce the sinking issues, and double check that the masses are appropriate. Unless you changed it, by default physics node apply a density of 1000 kg/m³, which might not be appropriate depending on the size/scale of your design. Setting the masses instead of the density might be easier

##### viorel\_gheorghe 08/02/2021 16:04:27
timestep I had lower it to 5ms, it solves the issue somehow. I'll tune ERP/CFM


is there a chance to monitor when the wheels get in contact with the 'low frecition" matetrial?

##### sa33 08/03/2021 01:47:14
Hi, I want to implement a stepper motor function by using rotational motor. Can anyone help me here, please?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/03/2021 06:39:30
You can use the regular motors and control the position:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor)



You may need to scale and/or decimate the position values to have more realistic behavior, but Webots-wise, the Motor node should be enough.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 08/03/2021 06:53:19
The low friction material could have a different color and the robot may have an infra-red distance sensor looking down, that would allow the robot to detect when it is above the low friction material.

##### LucasW 08/03/2021 12:42:16
Hi I'm doing a ROS2 project and I'm using multiple of the same robot. In my launch file I create  a loop that appends each controller to an array. Then in my LaunchDescription I call each instance controller[0], controller[1] etc. That all works well and each of these nodes have a different namespace. So, when I run the launch file each robot in my Webots world should get assigned the nodes in order but, they instead, get assigned one of these controllers randomly every time. This is not the intended behaviour.since I will run map merging and need the initial positions of a certain robot (e.g. robot1 has pos 1 1 0) to stay the same. How do I fix this? Thanks.


*behaviour, since

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/03/2021 12:50:42
You can use the `--webots-robot-name` argument:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/091357ab3e0cdd0f5f967c75bbcc87be65496cee/webots\_ros2\_demos/launch/armed\_robots.launch.py#L42](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/091357ab3e0cdd0f5f967c75bbcc87be65496cee/webots_ros2_demos/launch/armed_robots.launch.py#L42)

The robot name has to match the robot name in world file.

##### Troy 08/03/2021 14:21:38
Hi I used the urdf2webots tool to transfer my urdf(exported from SW) to proto, then I put the proto file in the proto folder, but I can't see it in the webots interface, does anyone know why?


`@Darko Lukić` There is nothing in the "PROTO nodes (current project)" do you know why?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/03/2021 14:28:16
The project structure should be:

```
|- worlds
|- protos
|- controllers (not needed if you use ROS)
```

Could you verify whether you misspelled something?

##### Troy 08/03/2021 14:28:59
No, I have the three folders


I exported the urdf from solidworks, then use urdf2webots tool, then put proto into protos folder

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/03/2021 14:32:27
Could you add this PROTO to the protos directory:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_turtlebot/protos/TurtleBot3Burger\_enu.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_turtlebot/protos/TurtleBot3Burger_enu.proto)

simply to verify whether the PROTO generated from urdf2webots is broken.

##### Troy 08/03/2021 14:35:57
it's working... so it's my proto's problem

##### LucasW 08/03/2021 14:40:57
`@Darko Lukić`  Thank you very much

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/03/2021 15:34:54
It's strange, `urdf2webots` should output valid PROTOs


Can you verify whether the PROTO is valid?

##### Troy 08/03/2021 16:26:14
i fixed it, because my output from SW is M\_Robot.SLDASM.urdf, and the output proto is M\_Robot.SLDASM.proto, I deleted the '.SLDASM' when export from SW, now it works


Does anyone know why my robot flys away when it touches the ground?

`@Troy` you have to set 'boundingObject' property

interesting approach! Thanks!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/04/2021 06:21:14

`@Darko Lukić` Ok, Thank you very much

##### FunkyPants 08/04/2021 16:19:29
Hey, I'm trying to use the supervisor API to track the initial position and final position of a robot in a simulation, however it seems that the ``wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_sf\_vec3f()`` function only returns the final values, whichever time step I use it on

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/04/2021 16:37:06
`@FunkyPants` Hi, what it returns is a pointer to where the information is stored. So I imagine you created 2 variables, one for the call at the initial position and one at the final. By doing so however they  both point to the same value so both are updated at every timestep. What you need to do is instead copy the contents of the memory using for instance `memcpy` to save the initial state.

##### FunkyPants 08/04/2021 16:51:21
ah I see


thanks for the info

##### viorel\_gheorghe 08/04/2021 17:08:13

is something more suitable?

##### kevmayo 08/04/2021 22:52:18

##### Troy 08/04/2021 23:22:21
yes, and I think it was because the model is too complex


Does anyone know how to add contact property to uneven terrain node?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/05/2021 06:19:46
`@Troy` The `UnevenTerrain` is defined as a proto file, `webots/projects/objects/floors/protos`. It doesn't currently expose the `contactMaterial` field so you'll either need to hard-code it in the proto body (`contactMaterial "my_material"`) or define a field for it and connect it to the body property using `contactMaterial IS contactMaterial`

##### LucasW 08/05/2021 12:45:51
Hi everyone, in the [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_core/webots\_ros2\_core/devices/imu\_device.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_core/webots_ros2_core/devices/imu_device.py) the ImuDevice should publish orientation data but it isn't. All the other parts are working (The accelerometer and gyro). Just the inertial unit isn't working. How do I fix this?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/05/2021 12:47:59
You are working with e-puck2? E-puck2 doesn't have inertial unit.

##### LucasW 08/05/2021 12:48:43
I'm basing it off of the Pi\_Puck which has a 9-DoF LSM9DS1 IMU which has one?


How may I add one?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/05/2021 12:50:08
According to this page it doesn't, so it wasn't included in the model:

[https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/e-puck2](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/e-puck2)

> 3D accelerometer, 3D gyro, 3D magnetometer


Maybe they missed to include it in the documentation


You can add the IMU as a slot


There are `groundSensorSlot` and `turretSlot`

##### LucasW 08/05/2021 12:52:23
It's an extra introduced by the Pi\_puck expansion board. It's in this documentation I believe  :[https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=Pi-puck](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=Pi-puck). I will add one to the slot thank you

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:27:57
I am about to download the MacOS version of the R2021b edition of Webots and I noticed the download is only 215MB.  Is this correct given that the R2021a release was over 1GB?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 01:48:49
A lot of the size used to be textures of models. I believe these are now linked to the web


`@nap`

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:50:58
Oh, but how do I get them locally?  It's not that simple on a Mac where thee App is treated as a bundle.


`@Simon Steinmann` meaning, when I do the update, I will loose everything that was installed before.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 01:52:25
I don't think so


You can back up the projects folder to be safe


That's where all the models and sample worlds are

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:53:33
Well, thanks for the explanation.  I would like if there's an alternate download which contains everything, or if there's a way of re-using the old stuff I already have.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 01:54:32
Update should not change those files anyways.

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:54:33
Ok, so the structure/organisation of all the files remains the same.  What if I copy over the file in the previous installation rather than replace it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 01:55:09
Replace it.


If it is that small, it won't include all the large texture files


And you can always back up that folder to be sure

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:56:02
Apps on MacOS are treated as containers.  To the best of my knowledge, installs are not done at a file level but rather a folder level.  So the old folders are removed and the new file structure replaces them.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 01:57:02
I'm a windows and Linux user, so I can't say for sure, but I think it should be fine to update


Can't you manually copy the projects folder in finder?

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:57:30
What I can do is backup what I have and then copy them back in.  My only concern is accidentally placing old files into the new version.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 01:58:02
Do that. Just update and try it first

##### nap 08/06/2021 01:58:27
I can manage it manually for sure.  The only problem is that I'm not 100% confident in doing this since I don't fully understand how Webots as a project is organised.


I'll give it a shot later today.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 02:01:01
The projects folder contains all models and sample worlds, but no functionality. The rest is basically the program. You dont need the projects folder to use the program.

##### nap 08/06/2021 02:04:29
What about the resources folder?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 02:04:43
that is needed for the functionality

##### nap 08/06/2021 02:07:14
Cheers, I'll try it later when I have some time to handle the 'just in case'.


Do you know if there is a version available that contains everything (in the way it was previously)?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/06/2021 02:10:17
i'm not sure how exactly it workds now and what they have done. You'll have to wait for a developer.

Reduced installation package size by using online resources for images, meshes, etc. (#2787). The local URLs to textures and meshes in previous worlds files should be updated to point to online resources, e.g., "textures/carpet.jpg" should be changed to "[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2021b/projects/default/worlds/textures/carpet.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2021b/projects/default/worlds/textures/carpet.jpg)".

##### nap 08/06/2021 02:19:50
I prefer to have that locally.  My internet isn't that fast, I have a limit on how much I can download, I don't always have internet available, and I prefer to have things locally to improve responsiveness.


1.5GB was not a problem for me since I'm not doing it often.

Can I get the length of a `MFNode`?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/06/2021 06:20:33
`@Affonso` hi, here you can find the list of robots available in webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots), you can also find them in: `file > open sample world > search robot name`


`@nap` From 2021b, the first time you load a world, the necessary assets (textures, meshes, ...) are retrieved and stored in the cache. So as long as they're in the cache, they're not downloaded again if that world, or another that uses it, is loaded again later. So instead of downloading 1.5GB straight away, you download it over time as you need it. There shouldn't be a big difference in internet usage compared to before, unless you manually clear the cache of course. The change only affects the Webots library, normally you wouldn't have writing access to these locations so your projects should be separate (but as mentioned you might need to change the urls of the textures if they rely on Webot's assets). If you still find it preferable to have everything locally from the get go, a better option would be to install Webots Development Environment: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/macOS-installation](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/macOS-installation)


`@SeanLuTW` Hi, you can use the `wb_supervisor_field_get_count` function [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_count](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_get_count)

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 08/06/2021 14:26:17
`@Kumar` no they are not. Webots uses proto files, you can see the proto file by right clicking on the robot in the scene tree on the left hand side on the window


If you have an existing urdf that you want to convert, look at "GitHub - cyberbotics/urdf2webots: Utility to convert URDF files to Webots PROTO nodes" [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)

##### Kumar 08/07/2021 10:22:02
`@DrVoodoo` - Post clicking select and few other clicks, I get as per the screenshot (no option to click on ROS). Could it be that ROS needs to be configured in webots or that ROS needs to be installed on my Windows system?

Based on this link [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros) that `@Darko Lukić` pointed me to, it is easier to work with ROS if you are on a Linux system, which I am not. I will be focusing with JetBots, but possibly in C or python, as I am working on a Windows system. Thanks `@Darko Lukić` `@DrVoodoo` for quick feedback and questions


Are there python controllers available for jetbot from nvidia?

##### Dave 08/07/2021 12:57:16
Hi,

I'm writing a Python API for controlling the e-puck2 for the University of Fribourg.



I've downloaded an hour ago the new Webots simulation program but I am having problems with the camera.getImageArray() method. I get a seg. fault



FYI : If I print camera.getWidth() or camera.getHeight() it works



Can someone please give me a small help pls ? Any idea ? Is the method camera.getImageArray() deprecated ?



Update : I've downloaded back the Webots R2021A, the problem is not appearing in this version. I guess its a segmentation fault due to the Webots R2021B

##### Kumar 08/07/2021 14:49:19
I tried to place a nvidia Jetbot robot in a complete apartment world. I was able to move it quite close to the floor by changing the translation points. However, it appears fallen on its side. How can I change its orientation?

I got the nVidia Jetbot into this world. It is able to turn right or left. But when I ask it to move forward, it is not able to do so. In the JetBot standard environment, it is able to move forward as well.

What could be the reason.Might it have something with the friction of this floor? Any suggestions on how to debug?

##### Veeeee 08/07/2021 23:39:44
Hey guys, I'm new to WeBots. Dumb question, is there a way to hide an object? Meaning let's say, I want to temporarily remove a box in the environment to do some testing and later on place back the box back to it's original place. Is there a way to do that without literally deleting the object and re-creating.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/07/2021 23:53:17
`@Veeeee` only with workarounds. Perhaps the easiest thing would be to create an extra test-world save


or you could put all your objects as children of a transform node, which has 0 0 0 translation. To test, you could change the translation of the transform node to lik 0 10 0 (10m upwards)


you can disable single objects by  disabling their bounding object and change the transparency to 1, however, this would require converting all objects into base nodes and is quite the hassle

##### Veeeee 08/08/2021 00:12:14
Thanks for the reply. Those are actually some of the ways I have thought of also. But those methods are kind of impractical 😅 . Wonder why WeBots don't have a hide feature built-in to their program. 🤔

a translation field is always relative to its parent.

##### Kumar 08/08/2021 05:21:39
Thanks `@Simon Steinmann` The IR sensor at 0 0 0 is higher than the JetBot. What I was expecting was at the same place as the JetBot as I expect it to be looking at the floor to detect the distance

Hey,does anyone know how to get the kinect’s internal parameters,such as the focal length?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 08/08/2021 14:34:22
A simulated in webots kinect? Or a real kinect so that you can simulate it? If the latter, which version?

##### Kumar 08/09/2021 00:47:31
Can you point me to a sample .wbt with robot with LIDAR sensor in a world and a controller associated with it?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/09/2021 06:05:59
When you create a new world for the JetBot, you should also copy the WorldInfo > ContactProperties from the default `jetbot.wbt` world so that it works properly.

Additionally you can find Python sample controllers here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-projects/tree/master/projects/nvidia-jetbot-collision-avoidance](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-projects/tree/master/projects/nvidia-jetbot-collision-avoidance)


here is a sample including the the Lidar device: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#lidar-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#lidar-wbt)


Hi Dave, which Python version are you using?

Could you please try the latest nightly build of R2021b? After the release we found and fix some issues with Python 3.9

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_6\_8\_2021](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_6_8_2021)

Otherwise you can also simply try to use a different Python version, for example 3.8.


If you need more parameters to customize, then I suggest you to copy and modify the PROTO file and create your own PROTO model version where you specify all the needed parameters.

##### llya 08/09/2021 06:44:29
`@DrVoodoo`A simulated in webots kinect ,do you know how to get their internal parameters?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 08/09/2021 07:05:57
`@llya` view the proto file, specifically the Camera Node portion. [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/devices/microsoft/protos/Kinect.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/devices/microsoft/protos/Kinect.proto)


In the case of a kinect the horizontal fov is 1 (radians)


If you need the vertical fov you can calculate it from the hfov and the image aspect ratio

##### Max\_K 08/09/2021 11:00:37
Hello, is it possible to change the texture(transparency, color etc. ..) of a solid inside a robot script? I know it is possible to change the texture by using the Supervisor API, but is it not possible to call a supervisor instance inside a robot controller? 

I have a robot with a distance sensor and when the solid passes the distance sensor, I want to change the color of the solid.

I works when the distance sensor is part of the supervisor script(thanks to Mr. Lukic 👍 ), but i want the distance sensor to be part of the robot and the solid to be independent

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/09/2021 11:40:03
Supervisor can access to all solids in the world. Any robot can be a supervisor. Do you get some kind of error?

##### Max\_K 08/09/2021 11:42:35
When i call Robot() and Supervisor in the same script i get the Warning: `Only one instance of the Robot class should be created

WARNING: 'mps\_controller' controller exited with status: 255.`


Oh, do i just have to use the Supervisor? `    robot = Robot()

    supervisor = Supervisor()

    timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

    index = 0

    while index < robot.getNumberOfDevices():

        print(robot.getDeviceByIndex(index))

        index += 1

    con\_belt = robot.getDevieByIndex(1)`

So i just have to replace the robot with my supervisor instance?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/09/2021 12:08:53
Yes you should simply replace `robot = Robot()` by `robot = Supervisor()`

##### Kumar 08/09/2021 14:15:39
Thanks `@Stefania Pedrazzi` - I will check to see whether copying WorldInfo > ContactProperties solves the issue. Also, thanks for pointing to github for the Python sample controllers for JetBot. I will check it out


Thanks `@Stefania Pedrazzi` for pointing to .wbt with Lidar. Really appreciate. Will check this out.

##### LucasW 08/09/2021 15:19:53
Hey quick question, though this might be more a ROS then Webots question. When I use some Twist (vel) commands and set the linear speed and angular velocity to a high value my robot in Webots kinda jitters and does very small turns but the odometery reading is really weird, it saids the robot went around in circles?


Is this something to do with the surface, if so how can I fix it

From the instruction on [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation) it says run './server.sh start'.  However that fails because it cannot create "log/session/output.log".

It will execute if we run 'sudo ./server.sh start',  but then it fails when it executes webots  ( when we bring up the web page -  ws://localhost:1999/session?url=webots://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/branch/develop/projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt )  



the problem seems to be - Webots says it will not run as sudo  if '--no-sandbox' is missing as an option . Sesson manager runs like that.

Hi, I am trying to use lidar sensor - Velodyne HDL 64E for retrieving point cloud. When using `lidar.getPointCloud() `with `data_type='buffer'` , the numpy array constructed from `np.frombuffer()` has shape of `(720000,)`. Shouldn't it be `(864000,)` equivalent to `(4500*64*3,)`  i.e. ((Point Cloud per layer)*(Number of layers)*(Number of dimensions),)??

In short, how the buffer is organised in terms of layer and the dimension and how to use it (python) (`data_type='list'` works fine for me, but it is slow) ?

`@Gustavo Cruz` Using the meshes of the wheel as `boundingObject` is computationally expensive, and at times source of instabilities, especially if they're very complex like in this case. It's better to model the `boundingObject` using basic primitives instead (a cylinder for instance)

`@chokings` from your code it looks like your wheels are the motors, so you have to do call the "getVelocity()" for all 4 wheels


dont forget the "()" of the command


also it is better do initialize the TIME\_STEP like this:

TIME\_STEP  = = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())


this will take the timestep setting in your world info. For your main loop you can then do multiples of that like so:

`while robot.step(2 * TIME_STEP) != -1:`


It is bad if you have a basic time step of 32 and have a loop running at 50ms

Hello, I was wondering if anyone could help me. We are trying to use Khepera IV with the FLU system.

Previously we had used this script to use Pioneer3dx with the FLU system and it had worked ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/scripts/converter/convert\_proto.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/scripts/converter/convert_proto.py)).



But it's throwing an error with Khepera IV



Does anyone know how to use Khepera IV with the FLU system?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 08/16/2021 21:32:03
I accidentally posted the command wrong. Use only = NOT ==


Two equal signs are used as a "if" check in python. It means 'is equal to?' instead of "=" which means "make equal / store in variable"


For your second error, you have to use empty brackets when using getVelocity(). You are not setting or defining anything.

I have made a custom robot with a custom maze and want to focus on localization problems,

so I was wondering if Webots provides an API for extracting the map into occupancy grid format or a binary matrix, or any other formats, without having to create the map manually and put it in the controller or having to implement a mapping algorithm controller to make the map... so does anyone have any knowledge/experience in this topic? I would highly appreciate the suggestions.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/18/2021 11:00:48
Hi, you have to specify the material and texture in the `Shape.appearance` node.


Hi, no built-in API for creating occupancy maps is available in Webots. However you could use any existing library and just write a controller that interface it with Webots.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/18/2021 12:41:03
Inside your  `Solid` node you will have one or more `Shape` nodes: the mesh is specified in the `Shape.geometry` node and the appearance (material, texture, etc.) in the `Shape.appearance` node.

You should check all your `Shape.apperance` nodes and adjust the path to the texture that is not found.

`@Estox` The depth image expresses the range as a integer value between 0 (min range) and 255 (max range). Black means something is at min range or closer, white at max range or further. any grey values are linearly inbetween


hmm instead of int, it might be a float between 0 and 1. not 100% sure, but the process should be the same

It seems that your motor doesn't have enough force to counteract the gravitational force that is also applied by default on the vertical axis.

You should try to increase the `Motor.maxForce` value.

Hi, can someone point me to a software that can be used to make motion files for Nao ? Or is this possible directly from Webots ? I searched some of the old answers on this channel and found some mentions of Choregraphe. Is this the way to go?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 08/23/2021 14:15:11
I am not sure, but Choregraphe might be the way to go. However, you will have to somehow extract the pitch/yaw/roll values of each joint of the robot to export them into the Webots motion file format (as well as the timing information).

##### n33r4j 08/23/2021 14:19:12
Ah, I see. Do you by any chance know how the existing motion files included with Webots for the Nao were made ?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 08/23/2021 14:23:00
I believe somebody extracted the pitch/yaw/roll/timing values from some Choregraphe generated motions, but I don't recall how this was done in detail (that was a few years ago).

Make sure the ball has a physics and that the simulation is running. Then, you can `ALT + click on the ball + drag` to apply the force.

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 12:55:54
Hi,

Can we use an empty world, create a supervisor in an external python script, and then use the supervisor to import a robot?

currently we have several worlds, one per robot. It would make sense to have a world without any robot and just instantiate a new robot using  supervisor.getRoot().importMFNodeFromString(-1, node\_string)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/25/2021 13:02:19
Hi, yes this is possible.

But your "empty" world should contain at least a Supervisor node to be able to import other robots and objects.

I don't have all the details of your implementation, but it is probably simpler to already add the initial manager Supervisor node to the world rather than creating a python script that edits the world and adds it given that you will probably always need it to initialize the simulation.

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 13:05:43
a supervisor node in world? how does it look like in the world? curently we have only WorldInfo and texttures and a Robot in the world file

##### ulrikmf [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 13:06:06
Or do you mean have a world file with a dummy robot to import the actual robot we want??

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/25/2021 13:06:22
Yes, with Supervisor node, I mean a dummy robot with the supervisor field checked

##### ulrikmf [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 13:07:36
The problem we then got, is to instantiate the actual robots supervisor. How is that solved with only one controller ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/25/2021 13:09:35
I'm not sure to understand.

The controller of the dummy robot  will import the robot(s), then once imported the controller of the imported robot is automatically started by Webots (if not set to extern).

##### ulrikmf [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 13:11:15
We need a supervisor corresponding to the imported robot as well, dont we? To access devices etc in the robot?

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 13:11:36
yes the imported robot uses an extern controller


the ideas was that the script importing the robot would also become the contorller for the robot

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/25/2021 13:13:31
That's not possible.


The simple solution is that the "script" that imports the robot is the controller of the dummy supervisor robot initially available in the world.

Then this "script" (or controller) can start the extern controller of the robot just after importing it

##### oroulet [Premier Service] 08/25/2021 13:14:55
OK that  explains our issue. Not sure what is best for us. We need to think a bit

Then I get these:


Error: wb\_motor\_set\_position() called with an invalid 'position' argument (NaN).


Screen is still all black

Very odd, not having any issue like that. Was it a fresh install or you used previous versions of webots before?

##### Mad Ks 08/25/2021 23:29:19
fresh install


everyone I ask about this, who have used Webots before, have not seen this issue.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/25/2021 23:31:26
Can you send me the E-puck.proto file mentioned in the warning above?

##### Mad Ks 08/26/2021 00:37:18
Were you able to download the file I sent `@DDaniel`?


I installed Webots on my old mac and it seems to work fine although its a bit slow

##### Kumar 08/26/2021 06:17:17
Is it possible to create a world, in webots, similar to the world in [https://youtu.be/VZdsxCrlJwY](https://youtu.be/VZdsxCrlJwY) ? The simulated world looks so much more realistic than what I have seen typical worlds in webots to be.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/26/2021 08:05:59
- an example of a similar robot is in the `sojourner.wbt` world

- an example of a similar world could be the `mavic.wbt` simulation

The worlds and models in Webots are typically optimized for simulation performance and physical realism. There is a support for visually realistic simulations (e.g. physical rendering), but you need to import high quality models.

##### Kumar 08/26/2021 09:07:22
Thanks `@Darko Lukić` for the pointers and input for how visually realistic simulations can be done.

##### Gustavo Cruz 08/26/2021 10:24:24
Hi!



I'm trying to implement a Web Simulation, but I'm having problems with the Webots streaming viewer.



I am using a streaming viewer that is available in the Webots User Guide, but some functions of it are not working in my simulation.



The Connect(Disconnect) and Run(Pause) options are working, but the Upload Controller and Reset options are not making any changes to the simulation.



The simulation is receiving the commands sent by the streaming viewer, but no changes are being made.



I even changed the controller name to "supervisor" but it didn't solve the problem.



Does anyone know how to solve this problem?



URL I'm using: ws://localhost:1999/session?url=webots://github.com/GustavoSC1/roboDois/blob/main/diff-drive-robot/worlds/empty.wbt



I'm using the R2021b version of Webots.



Thanks for listening.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/26/2021 10:56:40
What is the type of your RobotGrab2 PROTO?


Given that you are using a modified version of the Webots streaming viewer, it is not very clear how do you want to implement the reset and upload controller method.

Note that simulation reset is available in the default Webots streaming toolbar.

From your logs its seems that you are sending the "upload" message to the `supervisor` controller. This could be a good start to implement this functionality that is not provided by the Webots default streaming viewer. But then, in your `supervisor` controller you should listen to the robot window messages and implement the upload functionality yourself.

##### Gustavo Cruz 08/26/2021 11:26:26
I understood. Thanks.



Is there any place that teaches you how to be able to edit the controller in Web Simulation? On robotbenchmark.net it is possible to edit the controller in simulations, and I would like to do the same on my server.

##### ulrikmf [Premier Service] 08/26/2021 11:36:27
Robot {}

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 08/26/2021 11:37:16
robotbenchmark.net is not using the Webots Streaming Viewer but it implements the Web simulation as explained in this section:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation)

But it is working on a previous version of the streaming so it is not the best example to follow for new implementations.

One option is to implement a PHP script that modifies the current simulation world file and updates the controller (if the path to the controller changes) or overwrites the controller file content stored on the server. Then you simply need to restart the simulation to take the changes into account.


So then, the warning should not be printed.

But to inspect the issue we would need the whole PROTO definition.

##### Gustavo Cruz 08/26/2021 11:43:08
Thank you very much for your help with my questions and for the explanation. I will try to implement some way to edit the controller. 🙂

##### lanzcc 08/27/2021 14:28:58
Can someone please describe what is supposed to happen when a force is applied to an object? I have tried to follow all the instructions in tutorial #2, but cannot move the ball. The force vector arrow appears, and its direction and magnitude can be adjusted, but thereafter nothing I do allows me to move the ball.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/27/2021 15:00:13
`@lanzcc` how heavy is the object? Perhaps the force you're applying isn't enough to cause a disturbance.

##### lanzcc 08/27/2021 15:44:45
The ball weighs 4.2 kg. How is one supposed to cause movement by applying force?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 08/27/2021 15:48:04
You're doing it right already if you see the orange arrow. Lower the mass just for the sake of testing it, and see if you manage to move it then. If it does, it means you need to apply a stronger force (longer arrow, might need to zoom out or increase the `WorldInfo.dragForceScale` parameter)


Using that method however you don't have much control, if you need  a more precise way of adding an external disturbance, you can use a supervisor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)

Hi all, 

I was trying to publish lidar data from Wevots to ROS topic using an extern control. But always in the published ros topics I always get INF in ranges field.


Also I can't see anything in RVIZ.


Any idea what could be the problem

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/30/2021 11:47:27
If a measurement is outside of the range then the sensor returns INF

##### Tahir [Moderator] 08/30/2021 12:33:15
But why can't I see something in RVIZ when I put some object on front of the robot


def getLaserObject(self):

        self.current\_time = rospy.Time.now()

        laser = LaserScan()

        laser.header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()

        laser.header.frame\_id = "front\_laser"

        laser.angle\_min = -2.356

        laser.angle\_max = 2.356

        laser.range\_min = 0.01

        laser.range\_max = 30

        laser.scan\_time = (self.current\_time - self.last\_time).to\_sec()

        laser.ranges = self.laser.getRangeImage()    

        self.last\_time = self.current\_time

        return laser


This is how ros message is published

##### Tahir [Moderator] 08/30/2021 13:08:38
Well ros controller expose everything as rosservice and I just want to export the things which I want so thats why I am using my own controller


The python example which You provided, I've used but still getting inf

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/30/2021 13:12:58
Do you get INF when you print the values in the controller? If you turn on the point cloud what do you see?



Also, a few problems I noticed:

- The LiDAR is rotated in the wrong direction, it doesn't look in the direction of the barrels but in the direction of the forks.

- You use `getRangeImage` instead of `getLayerRangeImage`.

- You are missing the `angle_increment` parameter.


I recommend to use our interface because (otherwise) it is easy to create an invalid message or make a bottleneck. Why having many services is an issue?



P.S. If ROS 2 is applicable. In our ROS 2 interface, you can disable devices you don't need in a configuration file.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 08/30/2021 13:28:56
Well I am using ROS1


I just changed the lidar to one of the default lidars and solved the problem

Hi!

I'm trying to load urdf file to calculate inverse kinematic, but there have a error.



This is the github I take for reference:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse\_kinematics/inverse\_kinematics.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse_kinematics/inverse_kinematics.py)



Here is my code:

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.urdf', delete=False) as file:

    filename = file.name

    file.write(robot.getUrdf().encode('utf-8'))



Here is report error:

Does anyone know how to solve this problem?

I use R2020a revision1.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/31/2021 07:47:39

Please upgrade to R2021b

##### chawei2000 08/31/2021 08:04:33
Thanks for your helping.



But I already have Pr2 robot model in Webots, I don't need to load urdf file in Webots.

I use urdf file just for calculate inverse kinematic, since there have mechanism data of Pr2 robot in urdf file. 

So I don't need to calculate matrix by myself.



I'm thinking whether there have some method in python that can read urdf file, such as open() and read().



If I don't need to load urdf file in Webots, does I still need to update Webots version?


This is my Webots environment

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 08/31/2021 12:20:30
No need to update Webots in that case. If you have URDF you can simply load it, something like `urdf_data = pathlib.Path('your_urdf').read_text()`. However, in general, I would recommend using the latest version of Webots because of bug fixes and new features.

Hello, there are missing steps in the tutorial #2, and ambiguous references to objects that should appear.

I was thinking of an application scenario in which simulating a robot in Webots. So just a suggestion on my thought is needed. 

We can get the robot's world coordinates using supervisor node in Webots. Is it a good idea to get this value and publish as a pose of the robot by passing ekf localization and amcl?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 09/03/2021 15:47:16
Depends. AMCL and EKF will make some estimation error, so it is up to you whether the error is relevant for the simulation accuracy.


Where does it crash? It looks like ikpy causes the crash due to the invalid configuration?

`@Johan2021` hi, yes you can spawn it using `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string` or `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node` ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_sf\_node\_from\_string](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string)) and then remove them with  `wb_supervisor_node_remove` ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_remove](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_remove))

Hi

I would like to know if PROTO is being deprecated in the short/mid term in favor of URDF, or you are still recommending PROTO for brand new projects.

In case PROTO is recommended for brand new projects, is Lua still the language-to-go for PROTO scripting? Or is it Javascript?

`@Darko Lukić` Sorry I just saw some older comment re issues with udrf to proto; I found an issue with use of xacro:macro; see here [https://github.com/scottnortman/xarm7\_webots\_pkg/tree/main/description](https://github.com/scottnortman/xarm7_webots_pkg/tree/main/description)

Hi all, I am new to webot. I was wondering is it possible that I create a GUI in the visual studio which will be able to control the robot in webot and display the sensor reading from the webot?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/04/2021 08:00:41
`@cnbarcelo` PROTO will not disappear any time soon and will remain the standard for Webots. As for scripting language you should go with JavaScript if you start a new project, it's meant to replace Lua in the long term (Lua will be deprecated in a few years)

For one simulation can we create a Robot and Supervisor instance both


In my controller most of the things are done by Robot and now I want to get robot's pose via supervisor but getting an error


`Only one instance of the Robot class should be created`

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 09/06/2021 08:34:15
The Supervisor class is inherits the Robot class, so just replace Robot by Supervisor. You don't need two instances

##### Tahir [Moderator] 09/06/2021 08:34:24
Solved at the moment by using only Supervisor usage


Thanks man just did

If your package is based on `webots_ros2_driver` instead of `webots_ros2_core` than it should not happen. Note that we plan to deprecate `webots_ros2_core` in favor of `webots_ros2_driver`.

If my package is already working with the older version, and I need to prevent the robot\_state\_publisher, how can I do this?  I will migrate to the newer package, but I need to get what I have working for now.  Thank you.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 09/06/2021 13:27:36
It is declared here:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/f5f33a9035bf3a1152a9f9df4e1001d5db3375dd/webots\_ros2\_core/launch/robot\_launch.py#L59](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/f5f33a9035bf3a1152a9f9df4e1001d5db3375dd/webots_ros2_core/launch/robot_launch.py#L59)



Therefore:

```
ros2 launch webots_ros2_core robot_launch.py publish_tf:=False
```

##### scott.nortman 09/06/2021 13:43:19
Thanks, I did try that, but it did not work.  I was still getting conflicts with the robot\_state\_publisher.  This just worked though:              'robot' : {

                'publish\_robot\_description': False,

                'publish\_base\_footprint': False

            },


passed to the start\_device\_manager call

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 09/06/2021 13:46:30
If the `publish_robot_description` parameter is true then the `robot_state_publisher` node will receive a robot description. Given the fact that `publish_tf:=False` doesn't work for you means you are somewhere running `robot_state_publisher`, you are just not setting a valid robot description

##### SeanLuTW 09/07/2021 01:58:16
When I reduced the number of controllers to 1/3 (about 20) then it can normally run


Btw, if I run the same world with another device with better CPU, it can also run normally.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/07/2021 06:36:18
In many cases the y-coordinate of objects in Webots is at the midpoint of the object.  (This is true of simple geometries anyway, not necessarily true for more complex objects.)  I can't tell from your screenshot, but it looks like these plausibly do have their midpoints at the same altitude.  EDIT:  Actually I can tell from where the red/green/blue axes are on your robot that it's y-coordinate will correspond to the bottom of the robot.  If you instead click on one of your boxes, you'll probably see that their axes center on the middle of the box.  At any rate, you should find that their axes-origin is at the same altitude, with the difference being that the robot has its origin at its base, whereas the boxes have their origin at their middle.


Yeah, the interface isn't showing up right for you.  A workaround may be that you can drag upwards the little barrier between that resize interface and the scene tree above it, which may reveal the control you need long enough for you to use it.  It'd sure be annoying if you need to keep dragging that barrier up and down, so hopefully they can help figure out the bug!

Yeah i tried that almost full screened it as well by dragging, wasnt able to find it. Its weird because it was there on the first go. Ill try and tinker a bit more. 

Just another thing, if mess up with the essential saving steps, could that ruin my entire project ?

hey guys, i have downloaded a 3D model of a robot arm and I've imported it in Webots, but how do I control my arm with Python now? Also how do I define the joints?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/07/2021 14:21:36
`@Michael999` A good way of learning the basics is through the tutorial [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots)

##### Michael999 09/07/2021 14:22:11
thanks, I'll take a look.


Is there a way to mass-convert multiple "Shape" into "Solids" ?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/07/2021 14:53:41
If you right-click objects in the scene tree, there will sometimes be conversion options.  E.g., I think you can automatically convert transforms and solids back and forth.  I'm not sure you can auto-convert shapes with those though, since shapes are a bit simpler, e.g., in that they can't have further children in the scene tree.  So the shape->solid conversion you'll likely end up making is to create a solid node and then put the shape inside it as a child.



Occasionally, if I have a thorny mass-conversion issue, I'll open the world file in a text editor and change things there.  The syntax is pretty straight-forward, so if you do the thing you want once in the scene tree, you'll probably be able to do some copy-pasting, or even find-replacing, to make more copies of it in the text file.  (Probably a good idea to make a backup copy of that file first!)

##### Michael999 09/07/2021 14:56:32
Perfect, exactly what I was looking for, thanks so much.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/07/2021 15:00:54
I'm not sure what you mean by "essential saving steps".  The main saving things I remember about Webots are (1) to save my controller before re-running the simulation if I want the revisions in the controller to show up in the simulation.  And (2) to be mindful about saving the simulated world itself.  If a lot changes in your world during the simulation, then you likely don't want to save the world after the simulation has been running, because that would save the new state of the world.  So instead, when I want to change the world, I usually first reset the simulation, then make the changes, then be sure to hit save world *before* running the simulation.  (I can't count the number of times I've pulled my hair out because I made changes to the world either after running the simulation and/or before hitting run to test the changes, and then wasn't able to save those changes because I didn't want to also save the changes that resulted from having run the simulation -- one of the most frustrating aspects of Webots, IMHO!)

##### Michael999 09/07/2021 15:06:26
Little question, is it possible to model this type of movements in webots? this is more complex, just want to make sure if it's possible before I dive deeper into webots:

##### Michael999 09/07/2021 15:11:32
oh wow, that's very cool.

##### whiteplatin 09/08/2021 04:41:04
Thanks for that, ill keep that in mind.

I thought I read "eesential" somewhere, I guess the term was "fundamental",  but I was referring to this:

`When a Webots world is modified with the intention of being saved, it is fundamental that the simulation is first paused and reloaded to its initial state, i.e. the virtual time counter on the main toolbar should show 0:00:00:000. Otherwise at each save, the position of each 3D object can accumulate errors. Therefore, any modification of the world should be performed in that order: pause, reset, modify and save the simulation.`

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/08/2021 18:02:52
Yes, that quote is saying basically the same thing as the point (2) I was making above.


(I suppose this worry arises not just in the case where a lot changes over the course of running the simulation.  Even if not much noticeable has changed, still as the simulation runs a lot of numbers change by a tiny bit, e.g. as gravity constantly makes solids collide with the ground and the ground pushes them back up.  So if you save the world after it has been running, those numbers will be a tiny bit different from how they'd been, and if you do that repeatedly the numbers may end up having wandered quite a bit.  I've noticed this happening with joints eventually getting knocked noticably off their intended axis.  This is what they mean by "accumulate errors".  But the basic idea is still as I said above -- if you don't want to save the things that changed while you were running the simulation, be sure to reset the simulation before saving the world.  If you do mess that up, it's usually not a huge deal -- you just might have to manually go back and reset some things to be how you want them to be at the beginning of the simulation -- e.g. moving robots and objects back to their intended starting positions -- and save again.)

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 11:15:36
alright thanks for that. i guess its reassuring to know that the accumulated errors can be reverted even if its a painstaking process hehe


ANy chance for an official Rust implementation ?

`@kid07` You need to set the controller you defined in the `controller` field of the Robot node. To avoid spam and make it easier for people to help, next time please post the file instead, photos of monitors are hard to debug.

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 13:04:11
This is really annoying. 

After doing `Hands-on #5: Select the last node WoodenBox of the scene tree view. Click on the Add button  at the top of the scene tree view. In the dialog box, choose PROTO nodes (Webots Projects) / robots / gctronic / e-puck / E-puck (Robot). An e-puck robot should appear in the middle of the arena. Move and rotate this robot, the same way you did it with the boxes. Save the simulation and press the Run real-time button .` And nothing else ! The robot always collides with the obstacles (boxes). ANy idea what could be the reason for that ?

##### kid07 09/09/2021 13:06:32
Sorry about that. Thanks for replying. How would i do this ? Would i go to the controller void field > wizard> new robot controller ?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 13:10:29
First ensure your project hierarchy is correct:

- have a folder named worlds: put your world inside it

- have a folder named controllers (at the same level of worlds folder, not inside it): 

   - create a folder named: NAME\_OF\_MY\_CONTROLLER

  - put NAME\_OF\_MY\_CONTROLLER.c inside it

- load the world in webots, and select your robot from the scene tree and expand it

- click in the field called `controller` and select button

- the name of the controller you created should be among the candidates

Perfect , thank you so much. Let me try this out.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 13:13:56
`@whiteplatin` what is the name of the controller of the e-puck?

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 13:14:29
e-puck\_avoid\_obstacles


Im striclty following the tutorial


Ive got three wooden boxes, and  the e-puck keeps colliding on to boxes indicated by the red outer frame of the epuck

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 13:17:17
if you open the world `file > open sample world > my_first_simulation` and replace its controller with `e-puck_avoid_obstacles`, does it avoid obstacles?

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 13:18:19
I dont follow its already e-puck\_avoid\_obstacles


oh ok one sec

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 13:20:10
this provided example should have `epuck_go_forward` as default controller

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 13:20:19
yeah yeah i got u


it still collides


I have opened the sample world and replaced the controller as e-puck\_avoid\_obstacles


ok it collided a few times but seems to be avoiding obstacles now after some time


when the wireframe turns red, that indicates a collision right ?

no idea why its doing that

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 13:28:48
yes, it isn't perfect, it will touch a box here and there, you can play with the weights in the controller to ameliorate it, but at least it should attempt to avoid them

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 13:29:05
it plays with the box here and here


it looks like its trying to go through the box like thats the only way


is this an issue with webots or the way that the controller is scripted ?


Actually it looks like its trying to push the box 🤣


Is this an issue due to not having a dedicated gpu ?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 09/09/2021 13:33:21
It is the controller issue. Controllers in Webots are written to be educational and simple, but not robust and advanced.

##### whiteplatin 09/09/2021 13:34:22
If that REALLY is the case then I will continue with webots , are u sure its the script itself ? 

YOu would think that the script would be really well programmed ,seeing as this is the first thing we use in the tutorial


And it already ahem excuse my french, ***** up like this

I would appreciate some clarity , on why this tutorial no ONE ! is so messed up ?


This should be mentioned in the tutorial also


How can tutorial one be so messed up ? Im astounded by the lack of not giving a crap to absolute first time users in tutorial ONE might I emphasise


BUt the software still seems to be great, but some departments are definetly lacking

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 14:17:44
In the scene tree on the left, you need to replace the "void" controller of the Robot with your own (Distance\_Calibration). Also, in the controller file `Distance_Calibration.c` you provided in the zip you don't give any commands to the motors so it won't move until you do. (In the photos above you give commands to them, so maybe you're using the wrong file)

i did exactly that, it seems like it didnt save that part. ill attempt again. thank you !!

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 14:42:24
I'm having a problem where my controller crashes, without error message, whenever I try to read a camera that I dynamically added to the simulation using a supervisor controller.  Any idea why that might be?  (My current guess is that the fix added last year that allows controllers to detect dynamically added devices without restarting the controller doesn't quite work right with cameras?  Or it could be that I'm overlooking some other cause...)

##### kid07 09/09/2021 14:43:05
`@DDaniel` do you think that maybe I need to add a motor to the wheels as part of the code , to get the robot to move ?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 14:49:12
`@kid07` what you did in the photos is correct. The only mistake is that the motors in your robot are called `Motor1` and `Motor2` and in the controller you search the devices `motor_1` and `motor_2`.


Add this after initializing the distance sensor and it will move:

```
  WbDeviceTag left_motor = wb_robot_get_device("Motor1");
  WbDeviceTag right_motor = wb_robot_get_device("Motor2");
  
  wb_motor_set_position(left_motor, INFINITY);
  wb_motor_set_position(right_motor, INFINITY);

  wb_motor_set_velocity(left_motor, 6.28);
  wb_motor_set_velocity(right_motor, 6.28);
```

##### kid07 09/09/2021 14:51:07
😂 oh my word. Stupid mistake.  I’ll do that rn

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 14:53:38
Are you reading the camera in the same time step that you spawn it? Can you provide a minimal reproducible example (minimal world/controller)  that causes the crash?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 14:59:27
I've tried waiting 10 timesteps between enabling and reading and that didn't seem to make a difference.  I haven't tried adding a gap (other than `robot.step(0)`) between adding the device to the scene tree and enabling -- do you think that would make a difference?  It seems odd to me that it is crashing without error message.  Shouldn't it give some sort of error message?  (It does seem to hang for a moment before crashing, so I guess it may be that my Python controller is calling C Webots code that never returns, and then Webots ends up giving up waiting for the controller to come back, so just says that it has "crashed some time after starting"?)



The example I've been working with is far from minimal, but I can try to make a minimal one if I can't find some other solution soon.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 15:12:16
The value provided to robot.step is the duration, so needs to be different than 0. But yes it could be worth a try to wait one time step before enabling it. Also, since it's a complex simulation, just to be sure check if the controller works fine without this spawning of the camera (to ensure it isn't something else in the controller causing the crash.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 15:18:15
I often use `robot.step(0)` with supervisor controllers, as (I think) that lets whatever supervisor commands you've issued to the scene tree take effect.  E.g., if you want to add one node, and then add a child to it, I think you need to stick `robot.step(0)` in between to get the first node to be there ready to accept the child.  You're right of course that a step size of 0 doesn't cause the simulation to advance at all, and when I waited 10 timesteps, that was by calling `robot.step(timestep)` 10 times.



I did confirm that I can change whether it crashes or not just by commenting out a line that says `value = scope.getImageArray()` (where `scope` refers to the camera).


Also, I can tell that `robot.getDevice` is successfully detecting the camera within `robot.step(0)` of adding it to the scene tree -- e.g., that does return a Webots camera object, which does have the `.getImageArray` method that cameras are supposed to have.  The only problem is that the controller crashes when I call that method.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 15:40:28
That's correct, and if the camera object is defined it should work. If you can provide an example  (here or better yet on github) we can look into it (you're using 2021b right?). Does the `.getImage` method also crash?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 15:50:50
That's interesting.  Switching between `value=scope.getImageArray()` and `value=scope.getImage()` does make the difference between crashing or not.  So something's not working about `.getImageArray`


That may be a good enough solution for my immediate problem, if I can figure out how to extract the info I need from the getImage.  But it's still puzzling that .getImageArray should crash


Part of the reason I hadn't used `.getImage` in the first place is that the Webots docs about it don't seem clear on it.   The docs seem to say that this should return 3 bytes per pixel ("The image is coded as a sequence of three bytes representing the red, green and blue levels of a pixel.") , so you would expect the total number of bytes to be a multiple of 3, but it also says to expect the total memory chunk to be 4x the number of pixels, which fits with my observations.  So should I ignore every 4th byte?  Or is that byte some sort of alpha/transparency value?  The docs could be made much more clear about this.

Hello, how can I know the positions of other robots in the environment? Is it possible to enable a kind of communication between them?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:31:27
The easiest way to know position is by using a supervisor controller.  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)



If you don't want to use a supervisor controller, you may be able to get postitions well enough from a radar device.  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar)



For communications, you may find it useful to use Emitters and Receivers:

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 16:37:30
Right, I made a mistake... I want to know the velocity of other robots. Is it possible?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:38:20
A supervisor controller has quite a lot of omniscience, so can tell you that.  Otherwise, you'll probably be stuck trying to compute it yourself, using radar readings or object recognition camera readings

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 16:39:54
`@Justin Fisher` the format returned is BGRA.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:40:35
There are also gps devices, so if you can figure out a way to get one robot's gps device stuck like a tracker on another robot, that'd let you read its location.


That's really BGRA, not RGBA?  Edit:  I can confirm that it is indeed BGRA.  Thanks!

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 16:43:10
I have to use a Turtlebot Burguer3 robot, It only has a Lidar sensor so I will see the way to use a supervisor


thank you

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:49:13
You can sort of do this with lidar too, though I don't think it'll easily distinguish other robots from other objects in your environment.  *If* you can assume that the things your lidar sees are robots, then it should be fairly straightforward to get their position, and then to compute their velocity, relative to yours (though if you're spinning, that'll change their apparent velocity, in much the way that, when you're spinning on a bar stool the world appears to be zooming around you)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 16:52:06
`@ykopoblete` Supervisor is the easier approach, if you don't mind "cheating" in your application

```
WbNodeRef robot_node = wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def("DEF_NAME_OF_ROBOT");
const double *velocity = wb_supervisor_node_get_velocity(robot_node);
```


yes BGRA (and ARGB for Java)

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 16:54:00
I see, but even with that I'm not sure how the point cloud will note the change of position of other robot


How is for python? you need to import something first?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:55:02
Thanks for your help `@DDaniel`   I've now got my robots working with `getImage` which works well enough for me.  I still don't know why `getImageArray` was crashing, so there's probably a bug in there somewhere that y'all may want to fix someday


As a real simple first approach, I'd just take the closest point and assume that it is the other robot.


As long as the same part of the other robot stays closest (a big, sometimes false, assumption) you can compute its velocity (relative to yours) by its change in position (relative to yours)

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 16:57:16
yes, but what happen when you have a crowd? You will not know if a point corresponds to the same robot after a timestep

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:57:42
Yep, will make it tricky

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 16:58:44
Supervisor looks like a reasonable solution to those problems

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:58:51
More sophisticated approaches would probably try to cluster together similar points, and then try to make object-permanence conclusions about which clusters at time2 are the same as the clusters at time1.


It all depends on what the goal of your project is


if you're trying to learn about lidar processing, you'll probably get into the sophisticated approaches like I was suggesting

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 16:59:34
My goal is just collision avoidance while a robot is going to his goal point

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/09/2021 16:59:46
if you don't care about lidar and just want to set up some robot interactions, probably better to go with supervisor controllers

##### ykopoblete 09/09/2021 17:01:18
right. Thanks!

##### Fero 09/09/2021 21:09:02
Hey! I want to do that my robot turn when detects a collision but I cant make him stop, and then turn and then continue. Is like he is moving all the time. How can I implement that?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/09/2021 21:11:55
`@Fero` If you're controlling the motors in velocity control, set the velocities to 0 to stop it.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/10/2021 00:34:25
Is there a good way to get a supervisor controller to tell a field (like a solid's boundingObject field) to USE another DEF object?  I know how to do this manually in the scene tree, or in a .wbo text file, but I don't know how to do it via a supervisor.  I guess I'll experiment with `importSFNodeFromString` and see if something like `"USE BODYSHAPE"` will work as an acceptable nodeString.  Edit:  and this actually works fine.  I made the mistake of thinking it'd have to be more complicated, but it didn't.  Yay!


On the flipside though, it doesn't seem like `field.removeSF()` works to remove `USE FOO` contents from a `boundingObject` field, and while there is any sort of old content there `importSFNodeFromString` throws an error.  Is there another way to get an old `USE FOO` value out of the way?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 09/10/2021 07:15:45
I believe `field.removeSF()` should work. If not, can you file a bug report about it?

Is there a way to real time log simulation data like a lidar and imu with we bots?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/10/2021 16:00:22
The simplest sort of logging is just to use print commands in your controller to print things in the console that by default appears beneath your simulation window (and then copy-paste it elsewhere if you really want).  If you'd rather have it create a logfile, you can have your controller do that too, just as you would normally create a file in whatever language you're writing your controller in.  Of course, when the data that you're hoping to log are complex and voluminous, the log may not be all that readable, so you may want to consider using some sort of data visualization library to display the data in your log in a more digestible way.  E.g., if you use python, SciPy is quite good for this.


I'm not sure about other people, but my mama taught me not to open .zip files sent by strangers on the internet, so I suspect you might not get all that much help asking that way.  You may get more responses if you paste a couple screenshots of what you're trying to do and/or paste in relevant snippets of your code (probably surrounding them with triple back-ticks  so that they'll format nicely.


So I'm having trouble understanding what has changed about contact points since the 2020 version of Webots.  I can see how the ability to include descendant nodes will be very useful -- thanks!  But it looks like you're deprecating  `node.getNumberOfContactPoints`, which is something I'd found very useful.  When all I want to know is whether or not any contact is occurring, it seemed more efficient to just get the number of contact points, rather than requiring that all the contact points themselves be passed through the API, which seems to be the only option the current documentation allows?  It looks like the back end for `getNumberofContactPoints` must still exist as part of the new implementation, since it must be used to produce the second half of `getContactPointsPrivate` which is used in the current implementation.  Is there a reason to deprecate it?


Also, `def getContactPoints` in `controller.py` would be cleaner and faster if you rewrote it using a Python list comprehension, rather than slowly appending items to the list, e.g. using the following one-liner:

```python
      return [self.getContactPointFromList(points, i) for i in range(size)]
```

rather than what you currently have:

```python
      ret = []
      for i in range(size):
        ret.append(self.getContactPointFromList(points, i))
      return ret
```

Either your isp blocks the website, or your ip address is blocked by the server because it has been used in ddos attacks or botnets.


Since lots of those attacks are from Russia, it is possible, that whole ip ranges are preemptively blocked. But I can't say that for sure, just a speculation.

Hello! I have a query regarding the dimensions resulting from the linear velocity of the API function wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_velocity. Will it be in meters / sec, centimeters / second, meters / minute, etc.?

##### ykopoblete 09/12/2021 13:16:18
compare it with the max velocity of your robot


max velocity is in m/s

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/12/2021 13:19:02
In my case I built my own robot in webots. How do I determine the maximum speed?


To calculate the modulus of the velocity of my robot, I add the vectors of the linear velocities at x, y, and z. For example the result goes from 0.11 to 1.5, but I don't understand the dimensions

##### ykopoblete 09/12/2021 13:22:24
in general is in m/s

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/12/2021 13:23:14

1.5 m/s is very fast I think

##### ykopoblete 09/12/2021 13:25:39
I have a problem with this. When I call to the supervisor as "supervisor = Supervisor()", then I get an error calling "Only one instance of the Robot class should be created". It's obvious is because I'm using also the node "robot = Robot()" within the controller. But, wheter I can only user supervisor instead of robot, how do I set my robot's parameters?. For example, how do I get a device?


yes, at least I have a robot with 2.5 m/s of max speed

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/12/2021 13:26:39
`@ykopoblete` A Supervisor is just a Robot with extra stuff, you only need one of the two: `robot = Supervisor()`


`@DrakerDG` yes, everything in Webots is metric. The velocity returned is m/s

##### ykopoblete 09/12/2021 13:28:10
Thanks. So, to use it with multiple robots do I have to create a controller for each one?

Ok, thanks

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/12/2021 13:32:34
`@ykopoblete` I suppose it depends what you're trying to achieve. Any robot for which you need Supervisor powers needs to have the `supervisor` field set to true.  If you want multiple robots to use the same controller but want it to behave differently/uniquely for some robots, you can use the `controllerArgs` field to achieve this: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#using-controller-arguments](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#using-controller-arguments)

Using `Node.resetPhysics()` on a free-falling robot with spring joints seems to be very wonky, apparently allowing immense forces to build up in the springs.  Is there a good way to actually reset the physics on these joints -- i.e., to remove all of the accumulated velocity?  (I've been trying to achieve a sort of parachute-like effect by periodically (every other timestep) resetting the physics on a free-falling robot, which works great, except if the robot has spring settings on its joints, in which case the robot writhes around like it's in extreme pain, and then bounces away explosively when it finally touches ground and I stop resetting its physics.)


Okay, it seems like a workable solution is to use `joint.setJointPosition(0,axis)` for each axis of each joint to keep the joints from getting far enough away from their default position that forces accumulate without bounds.  I think we can probably chalk this up to a more general bug where passive joints fail to keep themselves within the min and max constraints specified in joint properties.  If the joints would treat these as hard constraints, as it seems like they should, then it shouldn't be possible for them to build up forces without limit...


Another puzzling problem.  It looks like Webots is ignoring the `emissiveIntensity` field of a PBRAppearance and instead just uses the same full-strength `emissiveColor`  regardless of `emissiveIntensity`, including even if that is set to 0.  I don't think I've changed anything that would affect this on my end since it was working as expected under the 2020b version of Webots.  Is there some change in Webots since then that would make `emissiveIntensity` no longer be taken into account?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/13/2021 09:00:01
`@Justin Fisher` In case of bugs, discord is not really the ideal place to report them. It is better to open an issue in the github page with ideally a minimal example that shows the issue. This way if indeed they are bugs they get addressed. We might not be able to look into it right away, so by opening an issue we can keep track of it. Thank you for the feedback though

Some pretty good fraction of the time, what I think is a bug is working as designed, and I just need a different explanation of how things are working.  E.g., with the emissiveColor thing, I half-expected that the answer would be something like "that's now just used for LED's, and if you want to make non-LED's glow more dimly, the emissive color map now does that".  



Another good fraction of the time, what I think is a bug is already a well-known bug, sometimes with a known workaround.  E.g., with the joints going out of bounds thing, I half expected to hear something like "that's a well-known bug that is forced by limitations of the physics engine.  If you want joints to stay within hard constraints, you'll need to use a supervisor controller to manually enforce the constraints".  



Since I'm working on a deadline (getting a Webots assignment ready for my students to do), I post here in hopes of getting one of those answers that can solve my immediate problem right away, but of course you're right that if I uncover a previously unknown bug, it'll be good for me to make a github issue for it (as I did a number of times last time I taught this class -- and I'm happy to see a fair number of bugs I reported last year fixed in this year's version of Webots -- thank you!).


It'll make readers' lives easier if you copy-paste code into discord, within a block-code chunk, set off by triple back-ticks .

Anyway, (A) it looks like you're trying to tell your motors to run indefinitely at a particular speed.  To do that, you'll also also need to enable the motors and set their position to infinite.  Maybe you do that elsewhere?  (B) It looks like you accept `throttle` as an argument to your function, but then you seem to overwrite it (if my rusty memory of C serves me).   Similarly for the `wheels` argument.  (C) On your screenshot I don't see any call to the robot's step function.  You need to call that to get the simulation to advance forwards in time so you can see the consequences of the motor commands you sent.  Hopefully you're calling this function from within some loop that does call the step function?  (D) It takes a bit of time to get device, so often Webots programs would get the devices just once at the beginning of the controller and store the list of them somewhere where your function would have access to it, so it wouldn't need to generate that list each time step.  (E) You said you wanted your function to accept the device tags of the motor as input, but you currently seem to overwrite whatever is passed as `wheels`.  I think it'd probably be more useful to pass a list of already-gotten webots devices to the function instead.  (F)  You try to store the results of webots get device in a list of type `char`, but that's not the right type.  (F) I don't remember quite how C strings work, but it looks to me like you're telling it that the device names should be length-4 strings, but then are using strings that are longer than that.



I'd encourage you to start with one of the Webots tutorials and make smaller incremental changes to it, testing that it works at each step of the way.

`@DrakerDG` I created a python controller for your line follower. I get about 1.65 m/s. Going faster would require more grip (higher friction)

I dont know why it runs so slowly. I would have to profile the simulation, but I only have the tools setup on a different OS.

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/14/2021 02:11:53
OK thank you.  Yesterday I doubled the friction and improved the performance, the tires stopped sliding in the curves.  The only thing is that as I increased the speed eventually the robots started to lift up in the front, similar to a dragster.  This happens at startup or when colliding with another vehicle.  I've recorded spectacular colosions

you could increase the front weight (by perhaps making the front plate thicker, so it has more mass).

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/14/2021 02:14:21
In my case with less light effects and without cameras it runs around 0.4x, but when recording between 0.1 and 0.2x


I thought about increasing the weight in the front part, but my idea is to keep the closest thing to the real robot and take advantage of the simulations to test the real design

Are the motors realistic? Does the real robot do a wheely?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/14/2021 02:25:52
It is a real robot, but the RPMs and the strength of the motors do not lift it yet.  In Webots I estimate that I have exceeded the maximum speed and that possibly that would happen.  That is why in faster designs a vertical turbine is added to make the robot not stand up.

Would scaling down a robot be a reason for "This physics step could not be calculated correctly" error? I had to scale down a robot to fit an arena we made for it, and the simulation occasionally makes this error. Sometimes, it makes the robot do crazy things like doing a flip, or flying across the map. Just wondering if doing the opposite, scaling up the map instead of scaling down the bot, would fix these physics errors

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/14/2021 02:45:09

Not, only in basicTimeStep of WorldInfo

##### duct 09/14/2021 02:50:25

In this case you need the vector in 3 components (x, y, z). In this way your robot can be estimate the distance in every component.



You can use a supervisor node to set the vector using a API function that wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f, thru an array of 3 values

`@yaroslaw` The `Camera` node has to be a child of a `Robot` node. You can create an empty robot node, add to it the camera and then move this Robot node around to the positions you're interested in (using a supervisor)

`@DDaniel` can you please have a look at my code if you get a chance 🙂


I’m trying to create a void  function that will allow me to adjust the speed of my wheels on my robot. My code isn’t working, I’ve tried to correct it using Justin Fishers comments. Ive also tried to find examples of similar functions online but no luck there.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/14/2021 15:26:29
`@kid07` your code has a lot of issues: variable names are not consistent (typos, different capitalisation, random brackets, ... ) the function return type is inconsistent (declare it as void, but when you define the function you define it as float), and the controller lacks the main loop (`while (wb_robot_step(TIME_STEP) != -1)`). It's probably worth going through the tutorials or trying to learn from existing examples. One similar to yours is `File > Open sample world > samples > tutorials > 4_wheels_robot`


You can try modifying this one that already works by splitting the part about the movement into a separate function

##### ykopoblete 09/14/2021 17:29:48
Sure, do you need the controller or all the work?

Hello

(Sorry for the horrible formatting in this message and with the screenshots)

In short, I am having some issues with loading the textures when streaming to a browser. 

First off, this is a (small) project that I have taken over for further development, so I have not written the "base code" myself. 



The issue is that the textures are not properly loading in the streaming window. The project was created using Webots R2019b, so I am aware about the change in 2021b where instead of the local url  e.g. "textures/carpeg.jpg" you are rather pointing to the online github link/source. 



I might have implemented this part incorrectly, but what I did was just changing the world .wbt file from 

```
appearance PBRAppearance {
    baseColorMap ImageTexture {
      url [
        "textures/metal.jpg"
      ]
    }
    roughness 0.5
    metalness 0
  }
```

to:

```
appearance PBRAppearance {
    baseColorMap ImageTexture {
      url [
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2021b/projects/default/worlds/textures/wood.jpg"
      ]
    }
    roughness 0.5
    metalness 0
  }
```

The error I get in the console is this:





I can't seem to find any solution anywhere, and I don't know if this is sufficient information to understand the problem either. Any input is greatly appreciated, and I can off course provide more information/error messages.

Simply using for example ``const double *angles = wb\_inertial\_unit\_get\_roll\_pitch\_yaw(tag)``.

If you need to use these value in a later step, then you should additionally copy them in a different structure.

Note that this is pure C coding the it is not specific to Webots.

Robot mysteriously somersaulting
> **Attachment**: [robot\_somersaulting\_in\_water.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/887809875122458624/robot_somersaulting_in_water.mp4)


I don't understand why my robot is somersaulting in the water in the above video when the wheels start spinning forward.  On dry land it would keep its footing perfectly fine, and its center of gravity is far enough forward that it doesn't seem realistic how it flips backwards.  The front and rear wheels are moving at the same speed, so even if the spinning wheels in water somehow produce lift, that should be similar between front and rear.  The forwards thrust is at the seafloor, and any drag on the body from the water should be similarly balanced both above and below the center of gravity, so I'd think that it would just slow the robot, not make it flip so violently.  Can anyone explain what's happening, and suggest what I might change to keep it from happening.  



I'd like the water just to slow the robot.  I had that working fine last year, in ways that never produced mysterious somersaults like this.  I'm not sure what changed this year, whether it's something I changed about the robots, or something that changed in Webots 2021?


Another somersault illustrating that this can happen even without much/any water dragging on the robot's body.

(Note that I'm remote-controlling the motors.  When I run them fast it "pops a wheelie".  When I back off, it settles back down a bit.  When I rev the motors again it somersaults.  If I did the same thing on dry land, it wouldn't even pop a wheelie, much less somersault.)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/15/2021 23:04:39
Perhaps the robot is too light and the water creates too much buoyancy

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/16/2021 01:42:56
All the parts are somewhat denser than water (except the head, which is very light, but also can't submerge in that shallow water).  I'm not sure how much denser than water would be ideal.  Intuitively, it seems like a buoyant robot's wheels wouldn't get very good contact with the seafloor, so shouldn't provide very much thrust.  So I'd actually worried that the problem might be that it was too heavy, rather than too light.  But none of this feels intuitive to me.



It seems like part of what is happening is that, as the robot starts doing the wheelie, that shifts more weight onto the rear tires, and the motors trying to spin those tires end up, via Newton's equal-and-opposite-reaction, spinning the robot's body up even more; and as those tires roll forward along the seafloor, and as the undercarriage feels drag from the water, that makes the problem even worse.  But, on the flip side (literally), it seems like the front wheels should have the same sort of Newtonian reaction helping to shift more of the vehicle's weight onto them, so I still haven't wrapped my head around where the asymmetry would come from that makes it flip backwards rather than forwards.  I guess the drag from the water provides a source of asymmetry, though this happens in such shallow water that it doesn't seem like it could be much (e.g. the second video above).


So this test confirms that what causes the wheelies isn't the direction of the seafloor slope, nor partial submersion of the robot body.  (I'm alternating between turning the wheels forward and backwards, and whichever way I go, it does a wheelie).

(Though I'd forgotten that I set the density on that big "puck" body quite low (half of water), so buoyancy may have been more of an issue there.  When I make it twice the density of water, it still wheelies some, but a lot less, especially in the backwards direction, regardless of seafloor slope, which suggests that bumper and/or head are playing some role.)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/17/2021 11:57:02
`@kid07` you haven't provided any `PID_control1` controller. The world file says the controller is `Heading11` (which also doesn't exist), by using instead the controller `Heading` (which exists), the robot does the job

##### kid07 09/17/2021 12:02:58
for the heading code, I didnt use any distance sensors but i have used it in the PID\_control1. can i send this code file separately ? im not sure  why its named something different on your side.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/17/2021 12:03:25
`@Rodrigo_03` Some of the intermediary solids between the base and the gripper appear to be missing a `Physics` node. Also,  when you add a physics node, make sure the masses are realistic. By default Webots uses a density of `1000 kg/m^3`, perhaps it is better for you to set the masses yourself to something realistic (if you wish to set the mass, you must set `density` to `-1`)


Webots will look for the controllers in the `controllers` folder (in a subfolder that must have the same name of the controller itself) and like I said the controller being loaded in the world file is `Heading11`, are you use your robot is actually using the PID controller and not something else?

##### kid07 09/17/2021 12:07:42
it definitely is using PID\_control1

it doesn't compile (should be `#include <webots/motor.h>` instead of `#include <webots/Motor.h>`), but even after fixing this I get an error because your robot doesn't appear to have any distance sensor (or at least none is specified in the world you sent). Again I have the suspicion your file hierarchy is messed up, did you send the right project?

Your `Turning` function appears to give the same command to the motors irrespective of the case since `speed_modifier` is by necessity positive due to the `abs()`. As such, the robot can only go forward.

Ok I see , but when I remove the absolute , the robot doesn’t move at all

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/17/2021 13:06:48
because you're giving the same command to the left and right wheels, they need to be different for the robot to turn (as is done in the `Heading` controller for instance)

Hello World, we're currently trying to send a flag type information from a supervisor to other robot controllers in the simulated world. What is the canonical way to do that in Webots? We have some sensors (currently a keyboard, we could add a touchsensor to emulate a button press), is there a way to send values from a supervisor? We also thought about using the custom data of the robots but that seems like a hack... Any ideas? Thanks!

thanks, are there flexible joints linkage of the robot?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/18/2021 20:39:49
what do you mean by flexible joints linkage? Like a ball joint? that would be hinge2joint, basically a joint with 2 axis, allowing for free rotation

##### dvogureckiy99 09/18/2021 20:41:33
Is it possible to make the joints linkage of the robot bend under the load?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/18/2021 20:41:48
no, only rigid bodies


wait, do you mean the joint rotates under force, or do you mean the link bends?

##### dvogureckiy99 09/18/2021 20:43:00
The second


maybe there is some way to do it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/18/2021 20:43:12

in pretty much no robotic simulator. That is FEM analysis

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/18/2021 20:48:10
you could approximate it, by constructing the links out of a chain of hinge2joints (bending in 2 axis) or hingejoints (only bending in one axis)


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/hingejointparameters?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/hingejointparameters?tab-language=python)


you can play with the spring constants and dampeners


When you do that, I would recommend giving the first JointParameters a "DEF" and "USE" it for the rest, so you can iterate by changing the value of one node

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/18/2021 20:52:42
This is not really something you can easily simulate in a rigid body simulation. You have to do slow FEM analysis for that. Whole different type of simulation and program

Maybe in Gazebo I can do this

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/18/2021 20:53:22
nope


Maybe PyBullet with SoftBodies


but it will never be easy to verify. FEM is really the only way if you want good data

hello, I'm deciding whether or not to use webots in a beginner's programming course. The course will use Python, and of course the webots docs say the the relevant objects "can be programmed in Python", but that doesn't tell me enough to decide. Can anyone point me to some actual Python code that would be of the sort - or that would at least be an expansion upon the sort that beginners would write? Or perhaps there is an extant world that expects simple programming I could see to do the controlling? Thanks!

The vast majority of existing sample programs (`File > open sample worlds`) use C as the language of the controllers however interfaces of all functions of the API are also available in Python, C++, Java, MATLAB so everything can be done in any of these languages equally (under `file > open sample world > languages` there's a simple example in each language). The corresponding API is documented in all languages as well (example [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_step](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_step))



If however you aim for challenge oriented tasks then perhaps [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/) might be more suited (the same tasks are also available in the desktop version of webots in the `samples` I mentioned before)

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/22/2021 07:55:41
I teach a cognitive science course for (roughly) 3rd-year university students with a variety of programming backgrounds, which for many is basically no background, using Webots and having them write their code in Python.  However, I did a *lot* of work to make things very user-friendly for them, including hiding most of the Webots API behind functionality of my own that gives them just the options I want them to have, and no more, and giving them a ton of well-documented sample code.  For me this was taking a course that had been taught with physical Lego Mindstorms robots, and figuring out how to do something that was pretty much equivalent using Webots during the pandemic.  The course works pretty well, though I certainly do end up spending a lot of time helping the novices figure out how to do the coding (a bit more than I did with Lego mindstorms, but not that much more).  So my answer would be that you *can* do this -- I did! -- but getting it to go well may require more work than other options you have available.



Another issue you may run into is that, if you're expecting students to run this on their own computers, many student laptops aren't quite powerful enough to run Webots as well as would be ideal (though this may depend somewhat on the complexity of the simulations you want them to run).  I managed that, barely, last year, having the students work in groups, with each group having at least one (usually exactly one) student with a powerful-enough computer.  This year, I talked the guys who run my university's high-performance-computing cluster into letting my students run webots on virtual machines there, which still isn't perfect (since the virtual machines simulate a graphics card rather poorly) but it does ensure that everyone with a fast internet connection will be able to run Webots quickly enough.

**And a question of my own:  can someone help me wrap my head around how joint positions work?**
> **Attachment**: [antbot\_with\_joints\_invisibly\_changing.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/890145553508343858/antbot_with_joints_invisibly_changing.mp4)


In the very exciting video above, this ant-shaped robot is spinning its wheels driving into the side of that crate, with something very close to net-zero motion.  The three segments of the ant's body are connected by passive ball joints with springs that should be pulling them back to position 0, which would put the ant's body in a straight line.  However, as it sits there not visibly changing at all, the positions on the three axes of each ball joints *are* continually changing, gradually building up until one of them actually far exceeds the maxStop limit that was set for it.  (When it gets 10% beyond that threshold, I have a supervisor controller manually set it back to just within threshold, which is when the robot jerks a tiny bit.)  **How can it be that the positions for the joints are changing when there is no physical bending visible at the joints in the model?  And why is it that the joints can go beyond the hard limits set by minStop and maxStop?**


(If it matters, the balljoint axes are perpendicular.  Changing positions on the first axis bends the ant left/right.  Changing positions on the second axis arches it up/down.  Changing the positions on the third axis twists the segment around its "spine", or rather where you'd expect its spine to be if ants weren't invertebrates!)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 09/22/2021 08:28:09
Could you simplify this simulation and create something with a single ball joint on which you can manually apply torques/forces from the graphical user interface to actually debug it and understand how/why it goes beyond the max/minStop limits. If on such a simple example, you notice a problem, it would easier to understand what's wrong and eventually report a bug if needed.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/22/2021 08:42:47
It seems like I must be misunderstanding something about joint position.  I'm getting different joint position readings in cases (like this video) where there is no visible change in the joint.  So, either joint position (as indicated by the position field in the scene tree or reading a PositionSensor device on the joint) isn't just a measure of an actual angle between the source and endpoint of the joint in the simulation, or there must be some way that I haven't wrapped my head around yet that multiple different combinations of position numbers for the three axes result in the very same physical position+rotation for the endpoint.  I know that 4D euler rotations do allow that sort of multiple-representations-of-each-rotation sort of thing, but hadn't thought that was possible for 3D ball joints.  If it *is* possible for balljoints, then it could be that everything's working as designed here, with it not having actually exceeded the hard limits of the joint, and just having displayed a set of position numbers that look out-of-bounds but are physically equivalent to a set of numbers that actually is in bounds.  (I do know from other cases that these joints can truly go far outside their specified hard limits, but in those cases the joint is visibly bent far out of position and the springs usually make them writhe around like they're being tortured, none of which is happening in this case, which is what made me think this case might actually be working fine and might just be poorly understood by me.)


Another piece of evidence is that if you use the mouse-drag interface to move a robot with such joints that has been running awhile in the simulation, as soon as it starts dragging, the joints instantly jump to positions that seem more like what I'd expect from the positionSensor readings.  Similarly, if you go into the scene tree and make a miniscule modification to a joint position that has been running awhile, the joint immediately jumps much further than that miniscule change should have caused, to a position that looks much more like I would have expected that position to look like.  So that makes me think that the "positions" that the positionSensors and scene tree are showing aren't really the current angle between the anchoring solid and the endpoint of the joint, and instead must be some other number.  And if you get it to interpret that other number as a joint angle, e.g. by mouse-dragging the robot or making a change in the scene tree, that makes the joint jump to a new angle because the number it had been displaying as the "position" wasn't the actual current angle.  So I was trying to understand what that other number was, and what its relation was to the actual angles?


I'm also curious whether there's a good way for me to get the actual angles, since joints' PositionSensors aren't doing that?  I guess I can use a supervisor to getPosition and getOrientation and compute them manually.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 09/22/2021 09:19:27
Yes, the supervisior option seems to be the best.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/22/2021 09:21:45
Too much math for me to do at this hour 🙂  Will come back to it later


So it looks like another potential answer is to use the translation and rotation fields of the joint's endPoint.  As far as I can tell so far, those seem accurate even when the joint's position sensor and the scene tree's display of joint position is not.



So it seems like most of this is just a bug in the position sensor/scenetree readings, displaying a number that isn't an accurate current depiction of the joint's angle, and which if you enter as the angle for the joint would move it to a different angle from its current one.  As far as I can tell, this bug usually doesn't seem to make much difference to how the simulation itself plays out -- everything visibly appears pretty much the way it should, aside from the position readings.  Probably it's the endPoint's translation+rotation fields that are actually responsible for where the endpoint appears in the simulation, and not this mistaken joint position field.  So it looks like the right numbers are probably employed in calculating the simulation, and its just exporting some wrong number for position readings. 



There is also another bug -- not sure whether it ultimately stems from the same cause as this one -- where spring-joints sometimes actually do escape their hard limits (both visibly and in their positionSensor readings) after which the spring behaves very violently.  I've seen that happen many times, but don't have a consistent simple way to reproduce it yet.  If I get one, I'll post a bug report for it.  Given that we know there's a nearby bug involving generating mistaken position readings, Ockham's Razor might suggest that a mistaken position reading is also being used in comparisons for the joints' hard limits, which might be what lets joints escape their limits.


(I had hoped to work around the escaping-their-limits bug by having a supervisor watch to see when joint positions escaped the limits and manually force them back within bounds, but that's when I discovered that the joint position readings weren't accurate, and hence don't seem to be a good indicator of when the joint actually has escaped its limits.)

##### Ayk 09/22/2021 11:31:45
Hey I have a different problem: 

I want to change the initial position of my robot (NAO). So i looked into the PROTO file and found RShoulderPitch, where I want to change the initial Rotation. I tried using the position and position2 property of Hinge2Joint, but it doesn't change anything. Any idea what I did wrong ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 09/22/2021 14:12:33
It is not enough to change the `position` and `position2` values in the PROTO file, but you should also update the `endPoint` `Solid` translation and rotation accordingly.

The computation of the new `endPoint` node `translation` and `rotation` is performed automatically when changing the joint position from the Webots scene tree. So you could easily take the correct `translation` and `rotation` value from there.

##### Ayk 09/22/2021 15:22:39
Ok thank you

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/22/2021 19:48:33
It looks like you get slightly faulty joint position readings even from simple 1D hingeJoints without any springs.  At any rate, I can (1) take a robot with 4+ wheels whose rotation is visibly apparent due to being wrapped with a rubber tire image, (2)  drive that robot around using varying motor setvelocity commands with motor position set to infinite, so the wheels will have experienced unequal friction forces from terrain, (3) pause the simulation, (4) go into the scene tree and change the position field of a wheel's hingeJoint by adding a trailing zero after the decimal point, which shouldn't make any mathematical difference, but (5) once that "new" number, identical to the old number, is entered into the scene tree, that will sometimes make the wheel visibly jump to a new rotation.  This suggests that the joint position displayed in the scene tree is not quite equivalent to the actual current rotation of the wheel.  Some of these differences seem large enough that I don't think they can be just due to floating point rounding errors.  And the differences get much more pronounced with ball/hinge2 joints with springs attached.

##### Gustavo Cruz 09/22/2021 21:26:19
Hi!



I am building a world for my line following robot. I decided to place some objects to make the world look like a city. The problem is that when I start the simulation an error appears saying that "The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex".



I have already excluded the collision (boundingObject) of the city objects to try to make the simulation less complex, but the problem remains.



Does anyone know if there is a way to solve this problem without me needing to delete the objects?



Thanks for listening.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/22/2021 22:15:16
Usually when I get that error, I have objects that are colliding rather severely.  You might try making sure that your robot is above the ground not overlapping significantly with it, and you might try checking whether the robot's mass is so heavy that it keeps sinking far into the ground.  Also, you should probably make sure that other objects in the simulation don't have physics nodes, unless you want them to move around as the simulation runs.  E.g. if one of your buildings is heavy and has a physics node, then it might be generating that error message as it collides severely with the ground.  (You said you removed boundingObjects but I'm not sure that works to remove them from the list of things that will be moved in the simulation, so I'd say be sure to remove the Physics nodes too.)

##### Gustavo Cruz 09/22/2021 22:25:08
I excluded all objects from the city and the vehicle simulation did not show any errors.



The problem is with the objects in the city, but I don't know why. None of the objects have physics.



When I delete the boundingObject from the objects, can there still be some kind of collision error?


I managed to solve the problem! The problem was with the objects of type Floor, I hadn't converted them to Base Node to exclude the boundingObject. Thank you so much Justin Fisher and Daniel Dias for their help.

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/23/2021 01:17:45
I'm puzzled by ballJoint axis declaration.  As far as I can tell, the axis that you specify under JointParameters3 is the axis around which the endpoint will rotate when you alter the position of that same joint parameter, which is pretty intuitive.   However, the axis that you specify under JointParameters2 is in fact the axis around which the endpoint will rotate when you alter the position in the *first* joint parameters field (simply called JointParameters).  And adjusting the position field under JointParameters2 makes the endpoint rotate around an axis that is perpendicular to the other two axes.  This mapping of parameter fields to axes seems quite unintuitive and doesn't seem to be what the documentation says would happen ("the third axis is computed automatically to be perpendicular to the two first one [sic]").  Is that just how it is, or am I misunderstanding something?


(Perhaps the documentation should say that the two explicitly given axes will be the ones around which the first and third degrees of freedom of the joint will rotate, respectively, and the joint's second degree of freedom will rotate around an axis that is perpendicular to the two explicitly given axes?  That would fit how it currently seems to work.)


Also, does anyone know how Webots computes the perpendicular axis?  Just with a cross product?  (Since joints' .position fields currently give false readings, I'm trying to figure out how to get a supervisor to compute what their correct readings would be.)

I struggled a lot to get Python imports working in Webots too.  The key is probably to add a `runtime.ini` file to the folder that contains your controller.  Here's an example:

```; typical runtime.ini

[environment variables with paths]
PYTHONPATH = $(PYTHONPATH):../../libraries:../../libraries/robot\_parts
```



This lets my controller import anything that I put in the `libraries` folder that is sibling to the controllers folder, or in its `robot_parts` subfolder.  Of course if the destination you're trying to import from is different, you may need something different in your `runtime.ini`, or you could probably modify you system path to make it available all the time.



It's possible that you may also need a perhaps-empty text file called `__init__.py` in any folder that you want to import from, to convince python that this is a place where importable modules might live.

Hi, I'm getting this error constantly. On the internet, and as far as I've seen here, almost all DLL load fails are about not finding a module, rather than the file not being accessed. The ways to fix those did not work for me (stuff with PATH), do you know how this can be fixed?

It seems a bit odd that it's looking for python37, when I think the most recent version of Webots stuff for python is python39.  Is there a chance that something you're using is out of date?

##### BobS 09/24/2021 07:53:29
I used python37 and webots R2020b because the example to set the project up used those


After switching to R2021b and python 3.9 I get this error

Hi, I created a PROTO with a custom shape that is imported from a .stl into a mesh. The solid is well created with the good geometry, but I would like to map a .png texture to it, and I have had problems finding out how to do it.


Here is an image of the .stl

If there is a better way to be able to add texture onto an external object, please tell me how it could be done, thanks!

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/24/2021 19:14:10
The deprecation warnings there aren't serious.  (Webots changed from using a variety of different commands like getMotor and getDistanceSensor to have the controller gain access to different devices to using a single one-size-fits-all getDevice command instead, but the old commands still do work, for now.  And it warns you that old protos may need to update the addresses for the textures, since many of those are now kept in the cloud to keep the download size of Webots small).  



The only thing that looks really worrisome is the failure to load error.  It looks like this may have to do with a robot window, which is the window you can open up by double-clicking on the robot, and by default would appear left of your simulation if open (NOT the scene tree viewer).  For most purposes, you don't need this (though a few robots do have custom windows defined for them.)  So one thing you might check is whether your robot window is open, and if so close it, and see if that helps.



Otherwise, my debug process would probably be to start simple and see if I can get some minimal working example, and then incrementally add bits to it until I discover which one causes the error, which then would at least help pinpoint the cause of the problem, which then might hopefully help find a solution.  Can be tedious...  Sorry not to know more!  (BTW: I'm just a community member, so it's possible that other people like the Webots devs would have a better idea.)


If you want to specify how your colored texture maps onto the your geometry (e.g. to say which vertices will draw their color from which parts of your texture map, and then it will automatically interpolate for all the in-between points) you'll probably need to use a TextureCoordinate node to specify that.  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/texturecoordinate](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/texturecoordinate)

##### mAxYoLo01 09/24/2021 19:26:41
I believe that TextureCoordinate cannot be used for a Mesh geometry, I wasn't able to find the link between them :/

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/24/2021 19:33:12
Short answer is I don't know because I haven't done much with imported geometries.  I'm not sure if it is supposed to import the texturemap alongside the imported geometry (in which case you'd probably need to ensure that whatever you used to export the geometry, e.g. blender, is exporting the texturemap too), or if you need to specify the texturemap separately, in which case something like a TextureCoordinate node is what you'd want.  I'd suggest finding a proto that does what you're trying to do, and use it as a model.  (E.g. there's a rubber ducky proto and a blender monkey proto that both do something in this ballpark, IIRC, but perhaps not quite what you want.)


Another small suggestion might be that there's probably little advantage to developing this as a proto, rather than just trying to build something in the scene tree that looks right, which can later easily be turned into a proto if you want.  I think the main advantages of protos are just that it makes it a bit easier to re-use them, that you can hide a lot of internal settings to expose just the parameters of variation that you want people to use, and you can write scripts to flexibly alter the contents of the proto.  But if you aren't using any of that stuff, may be easier to just work on building a single working example in the scene tree, and make it a proto later.


(You can right click on a proto in the scene tree to convert it to base nodes, and vice versa...)

##### mAxYoLo01 09/24/2021 22:24:19
Ok I managed to do what I wanted using Blender. In fact, the .obj exportation has all the data needed for UV mapping! Thanks for your help anyways!

Hi everyone, I'm a noob to Webots and have a question. Does anyone here know how the Supervisor robot can communicate/send info to another robot controller. I am using my supervisor to track everything in the environment and at times, I need my supervisor to tell the robot controller to do certain things.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/24/2021 23:40:14
`@smasud98` does the supervisor HAVE to be a seperate controller? You could just make the robot the supervisor. All robot controller functionality will work the same

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/25/2021 00:54:25
Aside from Simon's good suggestion of (0) making the supervisor be the same robot as the other robot, you can also have robots communicate (1) via webots emitter/receiver devices, or (2) by having a supervisor change a field that the other robot has access to, like the customdata field of a robot.

This is the first time I've encountered a simulation called webot, and I'm using it really well. I'm very satisfied and there's one problem with using it.

I made a stadium like the picture below, but when the robot goes up, it often turns upside down. Also, this problem appears in the console window.



[WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.]

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/25/2021 07:29:17
First you need  add a group node


In  group.children you add a transformer node. In the transformer.children you put a shape


You can define the form of the shape like you need and in transform node you can change position and angle of the shape

The group is ok, but you need put before the shape a transformer node.  Just in group.children


boundingObject.children

        group.children

                 transform.children

                          shape


You need little boxes to make your ramps too

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/25/2021 22:44:35
I've struggled a bit to figure out the pattern behind how keystrokes are sent to different robots' keyboard devices when there are multiple robots are in the simulation.  What I've ended up deciding is that, if a particular robot (or part thereof) is selected in the simulation window, then just that robot receives the keystrokes; otherwise every robot will receive the keystrokes?  Does that seem right?


If that's right, then my main puzzle is why parts of one of my robots keep getting selected, apparently randomly, as the simulation proceeds?  (In this video, I keep clicking on the sky to deselect the current selection, and then it automatically re-selects some random part of the simple neural-net visualization hovering over the robot's head, for no reason.)
> **Attachment**: [random\_selection\_changes.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/891456898866507776/random_selection_changes.mp4)


I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that the nodes in the neural net are procedural protos that update themselves to change their color as a supervisor controller changes their activation property?  Does a procedural proto updating itself somehow cause itself to become selected?  Tis annoying, especially when that also means the supervisor stops hearing the keystrokes!

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 09/26/2021 04:32:00
Thanks for the compliment.  These are a virtual replacement for lego mindstorms robots that I used to use in my class pre-pandemic, so I was trying to make a world that seemed sort of fun and approachable, but also would be a good setting to do Braitenburg-style light-following tasks, which is what that lamp helicopter hovering around in the background is for. 



I think the procedural protos probably are indeed responsible for the mysterious auto-selection I was experiencing.  Whenever you change an input field in a procedural proto, Webots destroys the old copy of the proto and creates a new one in its place.  If you did that directly from the scene tree, the end result would be that whenever you change a property of such a proto, it would become unselected, which would be annoying.  So they probably set it up so that whenever such a proto constructs a new copy of itself, that new copy automatically gets re-selected (so long as nothing else is selected).  That probably works great for when you initiate the changes directly from the scene tree, but is annoying when you instead initiate the changes from a supervisor controller.  Ideally, Webots would distinguish between these two causes and only auto-select the newly constructed proto when the scene tree interface caused its construction.


I'd suggest finding the main loop of the controller of the drone you're looking at, look to see what the keyboard shortcuts do, and then replace that main loop with one that effectively chooses which keys to press at which times, e.g., on the basis of comparing the drone's current position to the next waypoint you want to reach (though rather than actually pressing a key, your loop would instead do whatever the original main loop did when the key was pressed).



However...  At least on many computers, that drone simulation runs pretty slow, and my general experience with drones on Webots is that they can be a bit finicky and frustrating, or maybe it was just my lack of skill since I did most of that early on in my time with Webots.  (So e.g., the lamp-helicopter I made in the video above looks a lot like a drone, but it actually "cheats" and uses supervisor commands rather than full-fledged aerodynamics to move, since, even after a lot of wrestling with it, I could get it to stay stably upright as a drone only for about 95% of the time, which wasn't stable enough for my purposes.)  So I think I'd probably encourage a beginner to start with something less finicky, like the vehicles tutorials.

I set all the OpenGL settings in preferences to the lowest possible settings already.

I also tried updating my drivers.



I need to use the 2020 version, because the code provided for the assignment was built in that version and does not run on the 2021 edition.

Processor    AMD A8-6410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics       2.00 GHz

Installed RAM-memory    16,0 GB (15,0 GB available)

Type systeem    64-bits operating system (Windows 10), x64-processor



Now my question is, is it a lost cause to try to run webots 2020b on my machine, or are there still some things left to try?



Sorry if this is not the place to ask. In that case, ignore this message.

I found a way after watching YouTube. Thank you for helping me every time.


I made a custom robot. The appearance boundary was optimized by giving only the bottom and comb surfaces. However, we set up wheels and motors, and the wheels are moving, but the robot is not moving. Can you help me?

What's wrong? Should the boundary of the wheel be cylinder instead of transform?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 09/26/2021 13:14:13
The boundary object of the wheel  must be a solid, in the solid.children you need add a transform and in the transform.children you need add a shape with a geometry a cylinder

Hi, I have some doubts around ros2control and Webots. 

I've set up a simulation with an E-puck (I'm using the latest `.proto`, `webots_robot_description.urdf` and `ro2control.yml` from Github). Among others, its launch file has a `diffdrive_controller_spawner` and a `joint_state_broadcaster_spawner`.

- Why are are only the left and `right wheel motor`  referenced in the `ros2control.yml` file and not the left and `right wheel sensor`?

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 09/28/2021 15:41:58
The webots\_ros2\_control plugin can find associated motor encoders, so it is not needed to specify them in the URDF configuration.

Thanks.

##### mattjarvis 09/29/2021 00:08:47
Quick question: the documentation says that if you click on an object with the left mouse button and drag the mouse it will rotate the 3D view *around* the point which was clicked, otherwise it will rotate the viewport around itself.  I've tried version R2021b both on Windows and Linux and cannot get the viewport to rotate around an object that was clicked on, it only rotates around itself.  Is there something simple I'm missing?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 09/29/2021 06:19:11
`@mattjarvis` yes I think that might be misleading. You don't actually need to select the object, but when you begin the dragging motion the position of the mouse cursor matters. If it's above an object, it will rotate around it, otherwise it's the viewport that rotates

##### Kamil Domański 09/29/2021 10:54:36
Hi, I've prepared a simple simulation of a skid robot. I want to check how much torque the robot need to run forward and turn in place. The torque of each motor is displayed in the terminal, but it seems strange. When the robot run forward the torque on all wheels should be pretty much the same, but as you can see below the torques constantly changes and I don't know why. Do wheels lose traction? if yes, then how can I solve that?

ok, so i started over. I opened 4\_wheels\_robot example and changed only the controller. The torques looks better but why they have sinusoidal shape. Shouldn't they be straight lines?

Thanks for the response...I don't seem to be able to make this behavior work.  It doesn't matter where or what I click on, selected or not, the rotation is never centered around where I click.  The camera just looks up/down/left/right when I drag the mouse akin to looking around in a first person shooter in a video game.  Is this different from the behavior other people are seeing?

Hello!

I'm currently testing a GPS system for my robot, and I was wondering - is there any way to set object position (in simulation) using GPS coordinates? For now I'd like to create simple markers in specific positions to check whether my GPS guidance works correctly or not.

Thanks in advance

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/29/2021 18:27:08
`@FlamingToaster` you can use the supervisor api [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor) to change the translation field of an object


you can also use the supervisor api to get the position of the object

##### FlamingToaster 09/29/2021 18:28:18
Okay, so using the supervisor api I should be able to set such markers, yes?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/29/2021 18:29:25
what do you mean by markers? Like spawning a green glowing sphere on a specific position?

##### FlamingToaster 09/29/2021 18:30:00
yeah, something like that


but I'd like to use GPS coordinates rather than meters

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/29/2021 18:30:23
yeah you can use the api for that

##### FlamingToaster 09/29/2021 18:30:31

I have a question regarding position sensors. I was watching a "Position Sensor in Webots Tutorial", but it didn't answer my questions on obtaining the robot's translation using code.

say your robot is a vehicle. 



what if your robot could move up an incline? how would you get the distance covered then, particularly in the vertical direction?, and it is possible to break it down across vertical and horizontal? It seems like it should be a simple thing, getting the translation of the robot, but turns out no. so how do you get the translation of the robot using code? 

Let's say I want to know the (x,y,z) position of the robot relative to the WorldInfo, how do I do that?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 09/29/2021 19:04:33
You have 3 general options:

1. calculate odometry using the wheel position sensors (error prone and issue with inclines)

2. You us a GPS sensor


3. you "cheat" and use the supervisor api to get the positon


If you want to do it without GPS sensors and in a real-world way, I would recommend reading up on SLAM

For me, the only situation which makes sense is when the robot trying to move the wall. Two wheels touching the ground and have pretty stable torque and two are in the air and they have torque around 0.

A related question. I'm currently using the ros2control differential\_drive\_controller plugin, which uses joint\_state\_broadcaster to publish the joints' information to /joint\_states and /dynamic\_joint\_states. 

How could I get the joints' data (i.e. encoders data) myself? Should I have to write a plugin with the new pluginlib way?

## October

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 10/01/2021 09:18:00
1) Get the device with `myDisplay = self.__robot.getDevice('name_of_display')`.

2) Use `myDisplay.imagePaste()` (take a look at [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_image\_paste](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_image_paste), the parameters are the same).



Put the code in a custom plugin should do the trick.


If you just want the angular position of your wheel you can use a `PositionSensor` and create your publisher in a custom plugin, but can't you use directly the `/joint_states` topic ?

Hello, I am still searching for information that would allow me to evaluate webots for an intro CS course using Python. I have been directed to a site that uses Python to program a Thymio II simulation, but all the Thymio documentation mentions several languages not including Python. Does anyone know if webots has eductaional consultants? As with many large companies, it appears to be impossible to contact webots directly.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/02/2021 19:53:46
`@lanzcc` [https://cyberbotics.com/#contact](https://cyberbotics.com/#contact) here you go


but this discord is a good general resource, as well as the documentation on cyberbotics website


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials) this is also very helpful


what type of gripper are you using? Unless it is a magnetic or vacuum gripper, you can just use the physics simulation to actually grip an object. Closing the gripper, squeezing you box should create enough friction to lift it up.  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector) this link could help as well

multiple rays in distance sensors are just a way to approximate a real distance sensor more accurately. If you want several ray sensors, you have to add multiple sensors or use a lidar

But I assume the problem lies in the robot type, because when I attach the gripper to the extensionSlot , I cannot give physics to the Solids, and if I do it gives the following warning: Pionner2  (PROTO): This node is controlled in kinematics mode but some Solid descendant nodes have physics and won't move along with this node.


Any advice how can I solve this? Or should i change the robot type?

Hi,



I am intending to use Webots for teaching activities, but I'm experiencing issues when trying to use it on the computers at my university (Debian buster), the webots package was installed by the system administrator directly from the debian package.



I receive the following error message:



```
Info: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "/usr/local/webots/lib/webots/qt/plugins" even though it was found.
Fatal: This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: xcb.
```



By investigating a little bit further, I found that the problems comes from `libxcb-util`



```
>>> ldd /usr/local/webots/lib/webots/qt/plugins/platforms/libqxcb.so | grep -C 2 "not found"

```



I checked and the only `libxcb-util` available on Debian buster is version `0.0`, it seems that `libxcb-util1` is only available from Debian bullseye: [https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libxcb-util1](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/libxcb-util1)



Does this mean that it's not possible to use Webots with Debian buster or is there a workaround?



My understanding is that this is a consequence of a change in Qt: [https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-24967](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTCREATORBUG-24967)



In case there is no solution, I hope that my message helps other users

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/04/2021 15:42:25
Webots is officially supported and tested on the two latest versions of Ubuntu. I believe that some users reported successful use on Debian. However, I am not surprised that it doesn't work out-of-the-box with the prebuild packages (.deb) file, because these packages are made on Ubuntu for Ubuntu and depend on other Ubuntu packages. Therefore, I would recommend to build Webots from the source on Debian instead of using the Ubundu .deb packages.


You should follow these instructions: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation)

##### medrimonia 10/04/2021 15:46:57
Thanks for the answer, I tried to build it from source before posting, the build is successful, but when I attempt to launch Webots, I stumble upon exactly the same error which I believe is due to a dependency of Qt5.15 to a package that is not available on Debian buster.

##### vivip2231 10/04/2021 17:24:53
I found a sample world, it is the pioneer3dx\_gripper.wbt. It is basically the same solution like mine. I looked up the proto files of this projects and i can see that there is some phisics nodes given to the gripper Solid tree, but they are custom physics. Do anyone know some more information about this sample project, that can help me?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/04/2021 21:10:12
`@vivip2231` perhaps you can share you project. Or you could just use the gipper from the sample world. In general you have to add a physics node and bounding object to any solid, that you want to have collision, mass and interact with the world. Nothing special, just double click the physics node and add the default one. For gripping the only thing you should really watch out for, is to use simple geometry like a box or cylinder. Using Meshes (IndexedFacesets) can really screw up the simulation.

##### vivip2231 10/05/2021 08:01:15
The gripper from the sample world is not appropriate for my project, that's why i wanted to check up how it is using the gripper with that robot in the sample codes. The problem is if I add a physics node to the Solids, then they dont move along with the robot, because the robot is in kinematics mode. Maybe somehow I can turn off this mode for the robot?


And even if i could use the sample worlds gripper, i want to understand how does it work, how is it using the custom physics nodes.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/05/2021 17:50:23
Well you can't have your robot in kinematics mode if you want to have physics simulation

##### vivip2231 10/05/2021 18:45:21
Yes, i know. I thought that somehow i can turn that mode off. But anyway I changed the robot for pioneer3dx and with that it works properly.

##### R\_ 10/06/2021 05:37:42
Is there an example proto file for a simple mechanical loop within webots examples?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/06/2021 06:19:54
`@R_` the gripper in `coupled_motors.wbt` relies on mechanical loops for the parallel link mechanism and should be fairly minimal. It isn't a PROTO, but the logic is the same whether it's defined in the world file or in a PROTO

Hello, can anyone explain why this is happening? Why the animated geometry is going the oposite direction, that is.

##### R\_ 10/06/2021 09:49:41
thanks for the reply. I found how the solidreference node is used.


Is there a example to create a robot from `.stl` files as nodes, by authoring a proto (similar to how a urdf is generated)? I was intending to use the mechanical loop within a custom proto

##### medrimonia 10/06/2021 11:12:51
To follow up on this topic, doing a backport of libxcb-util1 for Debian9 was sufficient to run webots. The only remaining problem I have is that some of the textures are not loading properly with `Unsupported image format`. From what I've seen in the logs of this channel, it's likely to come from the use of another `libjpeg` version.

I will keep you updated if I solve it.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/06/2021 12:42:34
Yes, this is a known problem, Webots need to load a specific version of libjpeg (alias turbojpeg), it is a matter of installing this library and setting the path accordingly.

##### SeanLuTW 10/07/2021 06:00:11
Hello, can I get PID of current Webots by supervisor?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/07/2021 07:38:48
`@SeanLuTW` I assume you mean the PID of a motor (?). If you wish to change the values programmatically you can use the function `wb_motor_set_control_pid` ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#wb\_motor\_set\_control\_pid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#wb_motor_set_control_pid)), if instead you want to do it through a supervisor you can get the node corresponding to the motor device using `wb_supervisor_node_get_from_device` then use `wb_supervisor_node_get_field` to get a reference to its `controlPID` field which you can read/set using `wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_vec3f`

##### SeanLuTW 10/07/2021 08:09:51
Sorry for not being clear, I mean the process ID of Webots.

##### ShuffleWire 10/07/2021 10:09:05
Hello everyone ! I'm currently trying to get the force between mechanical parts (ie the force in internal robot link between part (hinge, slider...)). I don't have found any sort of function to achieve it. Is there anything I've missed ? 

Thus I'm exploring physic plugins to get this info. It seems that dJointFeedback [http://opende.sourceforge.net/docs/structd\_joint\_feedback.html](http://opende.sourceforge.net/docs/structd_joint_feedback.html) will hold the relevant info. Do you think it will work ?

##### TurnDownForWhat 10/07/2021 10:21:29
Hello everyone!



I am having some issues with the Webots simulation stopping after 0.5-2 seconds after being run. 

My question is basically this: Is there some change that I need to do, that I have missed? 



Some quick background: I have taken over a project after someone else, where he created a high-level mission planner system for heterogenous robots. 

Long story short, he used Webots R2019 (where it worked), and I am trying to update it to the latest version. 



I have read carefully through all of the changelog, and I've done the needed updates from the changelog that I found necessary:

- Changed local URLS to point to online resources

- Changed from .getMotor to .getDevice.

- Set the WorldInfo:coordinateSystem to "NUE", because all of the elements in the environment was suddenly turned 90 degrees (and all fell to "the side" when I started it)

- Updated the streaming version, changed the code in the setup\_viewer.js and index.html to match the examples under resources on the Webots GitHub. 



I can supply with more information if needed, as I am not sure what is needed.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/07/2021 10:23:29
Yes, I believe it's the way to go.

##### ShuffleWire 10/07/2021 10:26:45
Nice ! I'll give it a try ! 🙂

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/07/2021 21:55:45
In general in Webots, the controllers call the next simulation step. So the first thing I would check is, whether the controllers are the culprit. You can check this by setting all controllers to "void", this should just run the simulation. Also any potential error messages from the terminal can be helpful to troubleshoot

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/07/2021 22:07:17
There are several factors you may want to try tweaking to try to get your track's animation to match the physics of how it moves things.  (1) I think the one that's most likely to work is changing the track's `textureAnimation` field.  (2) You might also change some settings in the textureTransform for the associated texture.  (3) Another would be to confirm that you have your axes aligned in the way that the documentation says is required (esp having your y/green-axis point gravitationally upward, though I suspect that would be more likely to produce oddities in its physical interaction with items, rather than in it's animations).  (4) If you're using geometry-animation, rather than texture-animation for your track, you'll want to be sure to follow the documentation's requirement that "By convention the wheels are all aligned on a plane perpendicular to the Track node's z-axis and have to be defined in clockwise order starting from the one with the smallest x-axis position component."  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/track](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/track)

##### TurnDownForWhat 10/08/2021 09:55:42
Thank you very much for that tip! Tried to run it with void controllers, and the simulation time progresses as normal. Which probablt means the problem lies in the controlles, and at least it narrows it down : ) What I find most confusing is that the control worked on the R2019 version, but suddenly stops functioning properly in the R2021 version. I can't seem to find anything relevant to the case in the changelogs which indicates any changes to why the old controllers haults the simulation.

There is some threading involved, maybe that might cause the issue somehow. 

Furthermore, I get no error messages in the terminal, so there is not much to go after there, at least not without adding some homemade tracings

##### inbananawethrust 10/08/2021 12:29:40
does webots run with windows 10 + ros2?


`@Olivier Michel`


I understand this is a super easy question for u, and it might be included in the website


but i tried unity for ros2 and it wasnt a great experience.

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 10/08/2021 12:36:19
`@inbananawethrust` Yes you can use Webots with Windows 10 and ROS2 🙂

##### inbananawethrust 10/08/2021 12:36:33
oh thank god


just downloaded it


and when the assets loaded in it was like playing AAA games on gazebo

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/08/2021 19:30:44
<@190551990630088707> you can send me your project and I can take a look


Also when threading is involved, sometimes errors in other threads are not raised

Hey guys i would like to have a robot that spawns cubes in it's local 0,0,0 - something like a particle emitter - is that possible in webots?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/09/2021 12:45:37
`@mironix<inactive>` yes you can make the robot a supervisor and use the `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string` function [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_sf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string) and passing as string something like: `Shape { geometry Box { size 0.1 0.1 0.1 }}`

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/09/2021 15:19:15
do you call at any point the `robot.step(timestep)` function? This function synchronises the controller with the simulation. If you didn't, put your while loop inside this loop: 

```
while robot.step(timestep) != -1:
  YOUR_STUFF
```


the while loop in your picture seems rather odd, start with this instead:

```
motor.setPosition(1)
while robot.step(timestep) != -1:
  print(sensor.getValue())
```

##### mironix<inactive> 10/09/2021 16:20:52
Hello! you probably get asked this a lot and sorry for bothering my googling leads me nowhere -  is there a designed place to do things when the world loads to create some dynamic for example cubes? i know how to do it on start of simulation, but i would like to prepare things dynamically before i press play - should that be done outside webots in protos?

##### Beetlepig 10/09/2021 16:27:40
Thanks, that helped a lot. It now won't pick up the motors that I named inside of the 'claw module'. Do you know why that might be?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/09/2021 21:54:35
If you want to dynamically change a world, a supervisor controller is your best bet. You can add, remove and change  nodes in the scene tree.


You could also edit the world file directly and then start it up

##### mironix<inactive> 10/09/2021 21:55:20
you can do that in code?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/09/2021 21:56:03
World files are basically text files, so yeah you can do that in code.


But I would probably go the supervisor controller route

##### mironix<inactive> 10/09/2021 21:56:40
oh ok i understand now - make my own launcher for my world


and create it from template like with pystache - interesting idea - but i'll do the controller - i can synchronize the start untill the world is readyu - thank you for the help `@Simon Steinmann`

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/09/2021 21:58:12
Proto files also support Lua scripting, but that is more for changing an existing node, not adding new ones

So what's the judgment? Position? Or what?

##### Brubby 10/10/2021 14:16:09
The supervisor could be continually checking the position of the robot and once its at a position which is the end of the path it can set the position of the robot back to the start

##### BIN 10/10/2021 14:18:22
So how do I know where a certain point on the map is? I am not sure of its specific coordinates, do you have any good methods?

With this information?

##### Brubby 10/10/2021 14:22:25
well if your robot can get to the end of the path let it get there and then check the position field above to know where the end of your path is

##### BIN 10/10/2021 14:23:13
Thank you


By the way,do you know how to turn around at the end of the line?Also use position information?Can I complete that with a line sensor?

##### Brubby 10/10/2021 14:30:27
well i can think of two options based on what you actually want to achieve. Do you want the robot to actually use its wheels to turn around or do you want the robot just to be made to face the other way as soon as it reaches the end?

##### BIN 10/10/2021 14:31:22
use its wheels to turn around


I just want to accomplish this goal

##### Brubby 10/10/2021 14:40:16
Theres probabaly a few ways you can do this I can outline some but I dont know what method acctually works best is practice or is the simplest. You can make use of IMUs and integrate gyro data and keep rotating till you have rotated 180. Or you can think about the radius of the wheel and how many rotations of the wheel are necessary for the robot to have turned in place by 180 degrees.

##### BIN 10/10/2021 14:42:51
I was actually trying to figure out how to let the robot know it's time to turn. I don't know what message to take as the beginning of this command. Are they coordinates at the end of the line?

##### Brubby 10/10/2021 14:43:54
you could put a GPS on the bot and read the GPS data

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 10/10/2021 14:44:05
Always is in the end of the line path?

##### Beetlepig 10/10/2021 20:21:30
All of them

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/11/2021 03:46:42
I'd suggest double-checking that you're spelling the device names in exactly the same way (need to perfectly match the `name` field of the device), and that you double-check that the devices are contained within the robot node that is running that controller (since a controller can't control devices outside its own robot).  There also used to be a bug where devices that had been dynamically added into a simulation via supervisor commands would be undetectable until the controller restarted, but I believe that was fixed in a recent version of Webots.  Beyond those sorts of mismatches, I've never had any trouble detecting devices.  



If that doesn't solve your problem, it might make sense to copy-paste the code you're using to try to detect the devices here in case someone can spot a problem and perhaps also to copy-paste a screenshot of the relevant portion of the scene tree to confirm that the devices do have the names you're using and are located within the relevant robot.

Can someone please have a look, because I can't spot any errors, and I've got a deadline coming up?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/11/2021 13:30:08
Nothing jumped out to me as being wrong in what you posted.  You double checked that these are indeed part of the robot that's running your controller?  Do you have nested robots (one descended from the other within the scene tree)?  I'm not sure how those would divide their devices.  What's the error message it gives you?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/11/2021 13:38:55
Only the devices belonging to the Robot that uses this controller will be accessible, so are you trying to access the devices from another robot? Also, do you call the step function at least once before using the devices? (so after enabling them and before getting their data)

##### Beetlepig 10/11/2021 15:01:50
I'm using the step function in the other part of my code, but it's not even reaching that far, because the sensors aren't even detecting. There is one robot inside of another, but I don't think that I'm accessing sensors that are outside

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/12/2021 04:03:02
I like using Pycharm for linting too, and agree that it would be handy if the Webots python controller.py did include Python type hinting, at least for API stuff that ordinary users would use.  However, I'm not sure how much of this is hand-written, and how much of it is auto-generated again each time the C++ version of Webots that this stuff interfaces with gets updated.  If it is just handwritten, it likely would make sense to have someone make a PR adding the type-hints to controller.py.  If you'd like me to work with you on that, I'd be happy to.  If it is auto-generated, then the challenge would be getting the algorithm that does the auto-generation to produce python type-hints in the python code it generates.  Should be possible, since the source C++ code is itself strongly typed, but I have no idea how easy it would be.



Anyway, in the meantime, like you, I've resorted to explicitly type-declaring the things that I really want to have linted, but have opted to live without linting for most of it.



(Incidentally, it looks like you're trying to use supervisor functionality in Python.  I've written some code that makes that stuff a whole lot easier to do in Python.  Let me know if you'd like me to share that with you.)


My guess is that you probably need to update graphics drivers if you're getting shader compilation errors.

Who do you think we can ask about the CI pipeline? - I'm very new here 🙂 I don't think i want to use your toolset for now but i'll remember for future that you created something like that - might be worth trying to push out to the public.

Webots devs seem to be around here mostly during European working hours, so a question on here during that time is likeliest to get an answer from them.  It may help to ask it as a simple short question.  You could also open a github issue for it which may generate some discussion of possibilities there.


I think that controller.py doesn't seem to change all that much from Webots release to release, so even if it is (at least partially) auto-generated, the upkeep task of manually remerging type-hints with a later version of it might not be all that terrible.  It also seems to include some parts that look like they were probably handwritten.  Both of those make me lean in favor of thinking that it would be worthwhile for someone to go through and add type-hints to controller.py   But it'd be good to get confirmation from a webots dev?

##### mironix<inactive> 10/12/2021 21:20:34
`@Justin Fisher` it's made with swig - i have the makefile on the development channel


and it is only a problem of configuration - still reading up

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/12/2021 21:23:38
Ah cool.  I'm quite good with Python, but have no experience with swig.  If you run into questions about the Python end of things I may be able to be helpful, but it would take me more time than I currently have available to figure out swig.

##### mironix<inactive> 10/12/2021 21:24:36
I'm a multi lang guy - c++ is my main so i'll handle the in comment hint config there - just need to know how to make that correctly according to standard

##### D3cpt 10/14/2021 12:04:14
Hi, i am trying to update the FOV of my camera in a proto file. In their documentation, it is actually the horizontal FOV and can be calculated from the vertical FOV. 

So if the camera has a resolution of 1280 x 720 with a field of view of 90 deg (H) x 50 deg (V), do i still need to use the formula? if yes, is the vertical FOV 50? if no, does that mean i just change 90degree into radian?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/14/2021 15:13:43
In Webots, you specify just the horizontal FOV and the resolution, and it automatically computes a vertical FOV that will give you that resolution with square pixels.  Since you want your horizontal FOV to be 90 degrees, you'll need to specify that, which is Pi/2 radians.  You could use the formula to confirm whether this will give you exactly the vertical FOV you were hoping for.  Alternatively, if you have your heart set on having an exactly 50 degree vertical FOV, you could plug values into the formula and do some algebra to figure out what horizontal FOV you'd need to specify in order to get that vertical FOV.  Or if you don't care about resolution, you could tweak the resolution proportions to get exactly the horizontal and vertical FOV that you want

##### DanMag 10/14/2021 15:27:27
Hi, 

Between Webots 2021a and 2021b it seems that there was a change in the DirectionPanel: now it is not possible to add a text.

Was this an accident or planned breaking change?

happended in  [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/3156](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/3156) 

see

Webots 2021a: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-traffic?version=R2021a#directionpanel](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-traffic?version=R2021a#directionpanel)

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/14/2021 15:33:16
`@DanMag` in 2021b all procedural PROTO have been ported from LUA to JavaScript and currently the JavaScript version doesn't have an equivalent binding for the gd library, so in that version you currently can't edit the text (but can provide it as images). If you need that flexibility, you can still use the LUA version of the PROTO.

##### DanMag 10/14/2021 15:35:00
thx, well - I found that out when loaded a world generated in 2021a with the newer 2021b version. Is there a way to tell webots to use the LUA version meanwhile?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/14/2021 15:41:29
Not really, the LUA versions are no longer packaged, so if you want to keep using it seamlessly, you can overwrite the current PROTO with this

##### D3cpt 10/14/2021 15:46:17
i see. i will just use pi/2 then. Thank you!

##### DanMag 10/14/2021 15:49:13
`@DDaniel`  Thanks, I'll think about that, but maybe just using 2021a in parallel to b will be the better option 

may I ask one more question:

it seems that the textures are defined with absolute pathes - is there an option to set relative pathes (e.g. relative to the wbt file)?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/14/2021 15:57:05
I assume you mean locally available textures, if so yes it should work with relative ones too. I just tested by adding a random texture in the `worlds` folder and then using it by simply referring to its name in the url field and it works. You're trying to define the texture of what?

##### DanMag 10/14/2021 16:27:45
yes, I try to replace the existing absolute pathes with the username of another developer by relative pathes for a AdvertisingBoard. I tried to remove different parts of the path (also put the file into the worlds folder) but did not work. I guess I need to check what the working directory of webots was when it was started by our script

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/14/2021 19:10:59
`@DanMag` I have a python controller that changes textures of objects in the world.

Can we import matplot library into webot coding environment???

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 15:58:37
`@Majeedullah` yes, you can just import it as long as it's installed in your system


`@Meghana|GDSC` what do you mean?

##### Timple 10/18/2021 17:01:55
Good day, I would like to keep the world file and proto file seperated. This in order to spawn multiple (number unknown upfront) robots into a world.

How can such a thing be done?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 17:03:38
`@Timple` This is the standard hierarchy of a project: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project). Then you can use a supervisor to import as many instances of your robot as you wish

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 17:04:03
Maybe you can store your protos into the extra project path that you can define in the Webots preferences: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences)

##### Timple 10/18/2021 17:04:45
Ah, I didn't find the API to spawn robots using the supervisor. Do you have a pointer?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 17:05:24
You can use: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_sf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node) or [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_sf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node)\_from\_string

##### Timple 10/18/2021 17:05:54
This is really useful as well! We are using ROS2. And all robots have their own package. I guess I have to figure out how to dynamically compose the projects path in webots.


Still a bit new to webots I guess. I didn't get that `import_sf_node` could also import robots. 

The 'from\_string' part looks good. That means I can probably load the proto from a different ROS2 package using a script. And then pass it along as string. This means I would not have to meddle with PATHS.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 17:08:49
Yes, that's the way.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 17:11:40
yes, in your case the `from_string` method is more appropriate. You just need to make sure that it can actually find it, hence why if it's a custom robot, make sure to follow the hierarchy I posted before. If it's a robot already present in the library it should find it straight away, no need to have a protos folder

##### Timple 10/18/2021 17:24:33
What do you mean by actually find it? Can't I just put the complete proto as string?


Idea is some sort of game. Multiple robots can 'join'.


So current idea is to export a ROS2 service to spawn the robot. This could contain the string to be spawned.

This only requires a small utility that forwards this string to the supervisor

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 18:27:47
Well I guess it depends on the complexity of the robot. If the robot is defined in a PROTO called `myRobot` it's convenient as you only need to spawn it by doing `...from_string("myRobot {}")` instead of passing the full thing every time.

##### Timple 10/18/2021 19:07:50
The documentation kind of only states this:

```python
from controller import Field

class Field:
    def importMFNode(self, position, filename):
    def importMFNodeFromString(self, position, nodeString):
    def importSFNode(self, filename):
    def importSFNodeFromString(self, nodeString):
```


Is there any example? Because this does not really show how to use the importSFNodeFromString function. Except that it can be declared?

##### Majeedullah 10/18/2021 19:08:53
Can you people guide me how ti use display command to get the graph veiw???


I am not getting it from the code written iin the manual

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/18/2021 19:52:05
You simply pass it the description of what you want to create, basically the text as it would look like in the world file.  If you want to spawn the Nao robot (available in the library) at a specific position, you'd call: `importSFNodeFromString('Nao { translation 0 1 0 }')`. Likewise, you can spawn a Robot by providing its entire description: `importSFNodeFromString('Robot { children [ Shape { geometry Sphere { radius 1 } } ] }')`. As you can see it quickly gets unwieldy, so instead you can describe the Robot in a PROTO 



```
PROTO MyCustomRobot [
]{
  Robot { 
    children [ 
      Shape { 
        geometry Sphere { 
          radius 1 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  }
}
```

and just spawn `importSFNodeFromString('MyCustomRobot {}')`

##### Timple 10/19/2021 07:12:57
Thankyou! But how do I get to the `importSFNodeFromString` function? How do I get this function available after `from controller import supervisor`?


Hmm, that sounds way to easy! Sorry about that.

I was mislead by the autocomplete in my editor not recognising this function...

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/19/2021 07:18:54
no worries 👍

##### Timple 10/19/2021 07:19:15
Although your code snippet is much more usefull than the one in the readme right?


Ah, too bad: `AttributeError: 'Supervisor' object has no attribute 'importSFNodeFromString'`



My code: 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""spawner controller."""

from controller import Supervisor

# create the Supervisor instance.
supervisor = Supervisor()
supervisor.importSFNodeFromString('Robot { children [ Shape { geometry Sphere { radius 100 } } ] }')
```

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/19/2021 07:37:40
oh my bad, you need the field where you want the object to be spawned into


To spawn it at the top level in the scene tree it would look something like this:

```
rootNode = supervisor.getRoot();
childrenField = rootNode.getField('children')
childrenField.importMFNodeFromString(-1, 'Robot { children [ Shape { geometry Sphere { radius 1 } } ] }')
```

##### Timple 10/19/2021 07:45:08
Ah yes, this works! Thanks a lot


Why the `-1` in `importMFNodeFromString` if I may ask?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/19/2021 07:47:21
it specifies the position, -1 is to spawn it in the last position, 0 at the beginning etc

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/19/2021 07:47:28
This is all documented here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_sf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string)

##### Timple 10/19/2021 07:47:40
Ah, sorry, that is about the position, got it!


Getting from supervisor to node to field was not obvious for me yet. Thank you both for the assistence in getting there!

##### Brubby 10/19/2021 10:49:59
I am attempting to record any collisions that take place between any objects throughout the course of the simulation. I would like to be able to check if any two things are touching per time step and what objects they are, anyone know the best way to go about this beyond the ways listed in the documentation since some of my objects are not robots. I am trying to write some collision detection logic using contact points but unfortunately my controller keeps crashing when i try and acces the point attribute of a ContactPoint object

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/19/2021 12:54:06
`@Brubby` it doesn't have to be a Robot, all you need is to be able to get a node reference of it. But I believe you have to go through the entire list of objects you're interested in and check their contact points (if any). Have you taken a look at the `cylinder_stack.wbt` example? It could be of help to know how to access the information you seek

##### Brubby 10/19/2021 13:38:38
Thanks Ive had a look and the way I was going to go about this is to look at the contact points for the object but i need to know what it collided into so i was then going to look at the contact points for all the other objects and use the 'point' attribute which gives the global position of the contact point to find the two objects which have the 'same' contact point location. This is necessary since there are 2 robots and i need to know what they each collided into. Now the trouble im having is with the ContactPoint object im able to access the node\_id attribute but when im try to access the 'point' attribute the controller crashes. I either need to fix the crashing issue or find another way to detect all collisions. Any suggestions for either?

Any idea on how to fix that?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/20/2021 08:24:06
`@mAxYoLo01` In the PROTO you're only specifying the mesh which only describes the geometry, not the appearance. Since it's working when importing it from the menu, you can either export the result (first image) into `.wbo` and use that instead of PROTO. If you actually need a PROTO, you can look at how the appearance of the shape was defined as (in the scene tree or world file) and do the same in your PROTO

##### mAxYoLo01 10/20/2021 08:26:06
Does it mean there is no way to simply define a PROTO with a mesh and its material? Like I always need to add the huge texture and faceset coordinates? The goal of this was to avoid it so I had clean PROTO files

##### Brubby 10/20/2021 08:42:24

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/20/2021 09:00:21
Afraid not, but if it's meant to be a static object in the environment (that doesn't need to change itself), then using `wbo` might be better than PROTO


you can find here the instructions to setup the development environment: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki).

Hi everyone. I've been asking in the GitHub discussions, but perhaps there is a larger pool of people here who would know: how to set the initial joint positions of a UR-like robot in Webots? The base model is horizontal, but I would like to set a custom starting position without having to move it there at the beginning of the simulation. I have not found a satisfying solution via PROTO file editing or a supervisor...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/21/2021 05:57:28
`@Solenoid` The starting positions are encoded in the .wbproj file, which gets created when you open and save a world


specifically in the "hidden position" attribute


just open the world with your robot, run the simulation and put the robot in the position you want. Save the world under a new name. A .wbproj file should be created. Open it and inspect it. you can clean it up and just extract the hidden positions and put them into the .wbproj file of the original world

##### Solenoid 10/21/2021 07:31:17
`@Simon Steinmann` Thank you for the advice, I'll try that. It sounds like a very convoluted way to do something I would expect to be quite common... then again not having found anybody having the same issue perhaps I'm wrong. Anyway, it would be super cool if we could set the initial joint positions via some arguments in the robot tree.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/21/2021 07:33:02
Normally you can, but since this Robot is a PROTO, they have not been made visible hence why you'd need to change the PROTO itself. I've answered you on the github discussion by the way.

##### Solenoid 10/21/2021 08:59:51
`@DDaniel` Thank you very much. I'm starting to understand the issue at hand. I wanted to avoid modifying the PROTO, thinking that this is a flawless instance of the robot that may be updated officially (similar to ROS URDF files that should be included and not really modified...), but turns out this is the ways to go. However, I have still not figured out how to set the robot joint positions in the PROTO file, nothing that I read from the documentation works... I mean, I seem to have defined the initial positions correctly (no error messages in the console), but the robot stays flat.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/21/2021 09:06:10
You can't simply modify the initial positions, you also need to update the rotations/translations of the following Solids in the chain accordingly. When altering a joint position from the scene tree, this is done automatically, but when modifying things manually like in the PROTO it isn't as straightforward unfortunately. You're absolutely right, if the PROTO gets updated (and it will with next update, as a heads up, we are converting everything to FLU/ENU), you'll need to re-do it, which isn't great. That's why I think the `wb_supervisor_node_set_joint_position` approach might be the less painful one as you'll simply need to add the `DEF NAME` to it, but I agree it's less than ideal

Hi, does anyone know how to solve this problem?

##### Thiago Costa 10/21/2021 19:22:57
Hi everyone, i'm trying to implement a playback function in a custom robot. I saw the "motion.h" library on Webots References and there say "The wbu\_motion\_new function allows to read a motion file specified by the filename parameter." So, my question is: I need to create this file previously or this function create it for me? And if the answer is "yes, you have to create", how could I do it? Apparently, this doesn't work as a usual C implementation. If the answer is "Not, the Webots create it", what is the file directory?


Thank's in advance and excuse me for my English

##### Solenoid 10/22/2021 00:34:59
`@DDaniel` Thank you for the insights. That really seems like a basic feature needing some work... I could get the robot in the required configuration for my task.

Hi, anyone knows how to properly convert an image from `camera.getImage()` into a PIL object/ numpy array?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/22/2021 19:19:58
Look at the api documentation. You could either get the image as a list (can slow down simulation quite a bit) or you could use opencv-python. I'm pretty certain the latter option would be faster, but you should probably test it


You might want to be careful and only simulate sensors that actually exist on the real robot. I don't know the sensor configuration on spot, but it is feasible that they use torque feedback on the motors to determine the Load on the leg and whether it has ground contact or not


But simplifying functionality through simple sensors can be a good approach

##### ydupuisCESI 10/22/2021 19:24:32
Hi, I am experiencing a strange problem using a ROS controller relying on keyboard input with Webots R2021/Melodic/Ubuntu18.04. The keyboard input is not detected (nothing published in the ROS topic and the robot is not moving) when I am in real time mode but works when I am in fast mode.

The problem arises even with the simplest example : roslaunch webots\_ros keyboard\_teleop.launch

 I have posted an issue on the Github. Not sure it was the right place. Let me know what's best.

Thanks

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/22/2021 19:45:44
Recently there was a fix to the keyboard, you should try installing the nightly build instead, that might fix your issue

##### ydupuisCESI 10/22/2021 19:48:50
Would you recommend R2021b-rev1 or R2021c ?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/22/2021 19:49:49
2021c is based on the develop branch, 2021b-rev1 is likely more suitable

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/22/2021 19:49:56
`@DDaniel` What do versions a b and c stand for now?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/22/2021 19:55:58
The 2021c was supposed to be an additional release (to the semestral one) with the entire library of PROTO and worlds converted to FLU/ENU, but given the amount of work involved and to ensure it's stable it will be released as usual in December, so we are just keeping the distinction in case a major bug is found which requires pushing out a revision of 2021b before then

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/22/2021 19:57:05
so you forked c from b to add all the new PROTO stuff?


thanks for the clarification 🙂

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/22/2021 19:59:36
Well, currently c only contains the develop, the FLU stuff is still on a separate branch (feature-enu-plan) which should be merged into develop sometime soon

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/22/2021 20:00:09

##### medrimonia 10/25/2021 12:25:08
Hi all, I'm facing an unexpected behavior with respect to maximal velocity. On a simple robot with 3 DOF.

Although I did not specify any damping, the maximal speed that one of the joint can reach seems to be equal to maxTorque*timestep.



I tried changing both maxTorque and timestep and the equality still holds, if the limit is caused by some hidden damping parameters I haven't noticed, I don't understand how changing the timestep would have a linear relationship with the maximal speed of an articulation.



Two points that might be related to this situation:



1. The robot is not present in the world at the beginning but is spawn from the supervisor using importMFNodeFromString

2. I have tried using the 'getVelocity' method on one Solid at the end of the robot and it always return a 0 vector while the robot is clearly moving.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/25/2021 12:57:52
Did you try to change the `Motor.maxVelocity` value?


Also, Are you controlling the motor in torque, velocity or position?

##### medrimonia 10/25/2021 13:00:38
Yes I tried to set it to 100 or 1000, it made no difference


Control of the motor is done in position

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/25/2021 13:01:59
Thank you. I will investigate the issue and revert back to you.

##### medrimonia 10/25/2021 13:02:33
Thank you 🙂


(If that can help, I also tried setting the P of `controlPID` to 1000, it did not change the behavior)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 10/25/2021 15:29:22
I modified the project/samples/devices/worlds/motor.wbt example and observed a normal behavior: when setting the `controlPID` `P` value to 100 and `maxVelicity` to 100 and `maxTorque` to 200, the measured maximum velocity gets very close to 100, that is 98.7 which looks OK to me. Moreover, this is not dependent on the value of the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep`. I am sending you the corresponding code.

Hi. I am new to webots.  I am trying to simulate multiple robots and would be grateful for any advice on the best approach.  I noticed that in the [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/projects/samples/demos/worlds/soccer.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/released/projects/samples/demos/worlds/soccer.wbt) file, each of the soccer robots has it's own definition (e.g .  DEF B1 Robot { ... }, DEF B2 Robot { ... }, etc) .  If I have 20 robots in a simulation, is there a way to create 20 robots in the controller code, rather than copying and pasting the robot definition 20 times in the .wbt file?  Does anyone know of a project that does something similar?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/25/2021 16:09:28
Yes, you can spawn them using a supervisor. You can use this API function and the corresponding mini-example below it: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)


By moving you mean transporting? In which case you can use a supervisor and set the translation field of the robot from the controller

##### Haladin 10/25/2021 16:12:26
Thanks `@DDaniel` for your help.  I will study that section.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/25/2021 16:14:52
Some of the cars (not sure if all of them, but the BMW does I think) have configurable slots, you should be able to insert it in those


under `file > open sample world > supervisor.wbt` there is an example of this, where the ball's position is moved around by a supervisor


it's in C though, but the principle is the same no matter the language

##### Majeedullah 10/25/2021 16:19:11
Ok thanks, i will check, if still there was an issue, i will text you in private,

##### Ranga Kulathunga 10/25/2021 17:16:47
Do the configurable slots mean sensor slots (top,  center, ...)? After inserting it into the vehicle, how can add controllers? How it can control the vehicle speeds and so on?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/25/2021 17:22:22
I don't think I understand what you're trying to do. To control the car you don't need the jetson, you can simply code the controller of the vehicle itself (you can checkout examples such as `file > open sample world > city.wbt`

##### Ranga Kulathunga 10/25/2021 17:30:37
Yes, I tried them.  Actually, I wanted to see how the Jetson behaves in a simulation. Thank you `@DDaniel`

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 10/25/2021 20:18:48
You can make a physical model of the Jetson board and see how that would behave in the simulation but I can't imagine that's what you mean.


If you mean that you want to emulate the Jetson. Webots doesn't do that

If you set transparency in different value of 0, your object don't will have shadow

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/28/2021 05:29:44
I'm running into a weird issue where my robots are inexplicably losing almost all of their traction, and just spinning their wheels to very little effect.  I've had similar issues in the past if I didn't have the robot node itself have a bounding object, but in this case it does have a bounding object.  I've had similar robots work fine, and have no idea what I might have changed that would have altered this.  (I didn't change contact properties or anything that should have affected this.)



I've also been having another mysterious bug that might be related to this: the body of one robot keeps turning itself green, which is apparently occurring due to the basecolor of its PBR appearance changing, which works as a multiplier on the texture imagemap.  However, this change usually does not appear in the scene tree (but occasionally does), and but if you change the basecolor that does appear in the scene tree slightly away from its apparent setting of 1,1,1 then the color pops back to ordinary.  That made me suspect that maybe that body, which is USED as the bounding object for the robot, was somehow forgetting its bounding geometry at the same time as it was glitching its color, which might have explained the loss of traction.  But unfortunately I can't get the same sort of resetting-values-in-the-scene-tree fix to work for the traction.  So I'm mystified (and very frustrated!).  Help?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 10/28/2021 06:12:06
I have it if I understand your context. You indicate that the color in the appearance of the PBR can affect the physical behavior related to friction, in your case your robot loses traction, right?

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 10/28/2021 11:39:21
I'm not sure if the color is what's reducing the traction, or if they stem from the same cause, or if these are just two different bugs that coincidentally are happening together.  My guess is common cause or coincidence.



I guess another way of asking my question is: can anyone think of anything that would make a robot lose almost all of its traction so its wheels would start spinning uselessly?  I can rule out many of the obvious suspects like changes in contact properties or other world physics properties, lack of sufficient mass to hold the robot down, center of gravity of the robot not putting enough weight on driven wheels, or the robot node itself not having physics or bounding object enabled.  What else could cause this?


Ok, I think I diagnosed the problem.  It was a case of common cause.  I'd ended up accidentally duplicating robot parts which meant many of my commands were going to only half the parts the robot actually had, so e.g., when you have two superposed wheels, only one of which gets the command to turn, the one that doesn't turn effectively reduces the traction of the one that does.  And when you have two co-located bodies with different colors (a hidden whitish one masked by a green-tinted one), making trivial changes to scene tree properties of the one that hadn't been appearing (the whitish one) apparently makes it become the more visible one again.



If only I had paid more attention to the little spokes in my wheels, I would have seen a set of stationary spokes in amongst the turning spokes and realized what was happening.  Or if only I'd paid more attention to the scene tree, I would have seen that it actually contained a lot more parts than the robot actually should have.  Bleh...


And I guess my list of "obvious suspects" above actually did include the culprit: not putting enough weight on driven wheels.  I usually encounter that culprit when I put the robot's center of gravity too far back on an undriven roller, whereas in this case the "undriven wheels" that were bearing a lot of the robot's weight were hiding right inside the driven wheels where I couldn't easily see them (aside from their stationary spokes being in amongst the spinning spokes).


For some reason the question "Do you have another wheel located inside your spinning wheel that's keeping your spinning wheel from touching the ground?" never arose back when I was teaching this class with actual physical robots!

Hello, I'm Anushree. It's awesome to see this helpful and active community.

 

I'm a student researcher working in swarm robotics, and webots seemed like a great simulator to get my project set up. I wanted to know if the webots Supervisor could be configured for swarm applications? Any tutorials/resources for the same would be really helpful, thank you.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/29/2021 09:59:56
A supervisor can do just about anything, including cheating. I don't know what exactly you need the supervisor to do but I'd say you probably can. You can find several examples in the samples `file > open sample worlds > samples`. The `curriculum` subcategory has some more advanced examples

Hello bro, how did you added Speed graph to that portion?? Can you please help me?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/29/2021 18:54:35
You could try the following:

1. export assembly as urdf

[http://wiki.ros.org/sw\_urdf\_exporter/Tutorials/Export%20an%20Assembly](http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter/Tutorials/Export%20an%20Assembly)

2. convert urdf to proto

##### Axel M 10/30/2021 19:46:44
Hi, I'm trying to find out a good setup for working on a M1 Max Macbook pro. Webots seems to be working fine on rosetta with the x86 build. I'm running ROS2 in a virtual machine (Ubuntu 20 arm, in parallels). I was wondering if the `webots_ros2` package could possibly connect to the webots instance running on the macOS host ?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/30/2021 19:48:51
I dont see why not. ROS is basically a network protocol. Nodes can run on different machines. Even over the internet if you use a custom vpn


This should not be webots specific. So look on how to connect ROS2 running on different VMs


might have to do some network configuration etc.

##### Axel M 10/30/2021 19:50:13
`@Simon Steinmann` If i'm not mistaken, on the ros2 approach (unlike webots/ros1), webots is not running any ROS node. The webots\_ros2 package directly starts the webots binary, and seems to be communicating with it through a file socket ? I'm not exactly sure about this

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 10/30/2021 19:51:20
And it creates Nodes when doing so, which you can communicate with

##### Axel M 10/30/2021 19:52:35
On the setup i'm mentioning, there's not ROS on the macOS side, only the webots instance


I guess waiting for an arm build to run on Ubuntu arm seems easier 😄

##### BIN 10/31/2021 03:19:10
Hi, if I can't use the math library, how do I figure out cos and sin in C when I already know radians?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 10/31/2021 08:34:06
You can use the math library

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 10/31/2021 11:53:47
Maybe thru trigonometry you can do it

##### BIN 10/31/2021 11:55:47
So how do you use it without referring to the math library


However, external libraries are not required

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 10/31/2021 12:03:22
What is the position that you need? You can use a table or array with the sin and cos values

##### BIN 10/31/2021 12:04:26

His coordinate output is not right, it seems not multiplied by the following trigonometric function, what should I do

##### Intries 10/31/2021 17:10:16
Hey everyone,

I tried to set up image-based lighting via an HDRi for my Webots World but encountered some issues.

Until now the lighting was done by the TexturedBackgroundLight, which is in fact only a predefined directional light wrapped in a proto for a given default skybox.

Then I tried to use a normal HDRi and the "Background" node, where I entered all the urls including the `IrradianceUrl` fields. The resulting scene was clearly changing brightness, when the luminosity value was changed, but the lighting seemed very soft and was not casting any shadows in the way the light was defined by the HDRi. After some searching I found this post: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2020-a-release#simplify-the-hdr-backgrounds](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2020-a-release#simplify-the-hdr-backgrounds) It indicates that image based lighting has been removed due to performance issues and suggests that the "Background" node has the same qualities, but in the screenshot that demonstrates this it can be seen that the lighting is supplemented with a custom directional light which is responsible for the shadows in the screenshot. While I understand that image based lighting can be expensive and overdone for simple simulations on low-end hardware, but it seems weird that this support was completly removed even if you are running high end hardware with a low real time (due to other physics related stuff). Can anyone give some insights why this option, which is quite essential for a pbr rendering pipline, has been removed and if it possible to enable it again in the future as an option?

##### Ranga Kulathunga 10/31/2021 17:27:51
Yeah sure `@Majeedullah` First right click on the robot or the vehicle. Select the show robot window. Then we can the window above. we can see all the variations of the actuators and the sensors on that.

Hi, I am writing controllers in Python and would like to use some python packages, I do not want to install these on my machine as this may corrupt the OS so ive installed them in a virtual environment. Now im able to get webots to use the python installation in the virtual environement by adding it to my environment variables and im then adding the packages to the sys path so the script is able to use them. This seems to work but isn't very nice. Is there a better way to make Webots run using virtual environement automatically and automatically have access to the packages in the environment?

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 11/01/2021 11:07:14
Hello `@Rizalfauz` , you should be able to control multiple robots by using multiple nodes.

Unfortunately we have not a tutorial with multiple robot on ROS (but on ROS2 we do).

##### Rizalfauz 11/01/2021 18:15:05

##### its-me 11/01/2021 23:06:29
how do you create custom robot models? i acquired an old MicroBot MiniMover 5 that i want to use for a personal learning project, i basically want to refresh it with a new controller and an android programming interface. But i think it would be helpful to sort out some of the controller work in simulation first so i want to get this added, i have measurements and data from the manual but cant figure out how to import a 3d model and define the joints


here is the manual that i have: [http://www.theoldrobots.com/book21-9/MiniMover5.pdf](http://www.theoldrobots.com/book21-9/MiniMover5.pdf)

page 37-39 shows some of the physical attributes

page 43 there is a switch connected to the gripper when it closes

page  75/76 is the start of the kinematic model



my hope would be to use Webots to design and build the driver firmware (even conceptually), then i can use the API to design and build the android control app using the simulated robot


like i said this is a personal education project, i think im going to make it as an online connected chess playing robot initially

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/02/2021 00:37:26
I like your arm robot, very nice project!


It is possible that your to import 3D model in webots, for example on OBJ format

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/02/2021 15:36:14
`@Expert_Amateur` you can do closed mechanical loops by using SolidReferences: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference#mechanical-loop-example](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference#mechanical-loop-example)

The sample `file > open sample world > coupled motor` for instance relies on it. Make sure to add a physics node in all intermediary solids or it won't work

##### Expert\_Amateur 11/02/2021 15:39:45
Got it, thank you so much!

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/02/2021 18:57:01
When you add multiple robots, each will launch and run their own instance of a controller, even if it is the same controller. If you want them to communicate with each other, there is 2 general approaches. 

1. You have them directly communicate with one another

2. Each robot communicates with a "Master" controller, which coordinates everything



In Webots you can use emitters and receivers for communication [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver)

They basically simulate radio communication

##### Rody El Hamod 11/03/2021 08:22:56
hello guys,

anyone knows how the physics plugin is called to check for collisions ? i mean it's called periodically for example every 1 ms or when the robot move ...


thanks in advance


do you have the urdf file of the robot ?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/03/2021 08:33:09
the function `webots_physics_collide` is called whenever a collusion between two geometries occurs (anywhere in the world), so during a timestep it can be called many times or zero depending on the situation

##### Rody El Hamod 11/03/2021 08:33:33
okay thanks

##### Guru 11/03/2021 08:38:25
No I don't, I am trying to use the proto

##### Rody El Hamod 11/03/2021 08:39:42
there's a urdf2proto function maybe there's proto2urdf

if you can get your hand on the urdf or maybe do it yourself since you have the proto and you can see the children and everything on webots, you can do inverse kinematics with ikpy library

##### vivip2231 11/03/2021 09:35:15
The tutorial helped me a lot, that's why my controller is working fine (no problem with that). I think the problem is maybe in the urdf file (I generated a new one), because I am not using one of the proto robot arms. Mine is the ABB IRB140  industrial robot, which I downloaded of their official website (CAD model), and I did the necessary things to the imported Robot node. Like i gave the corresponding max,min positions to the motors, specified the velocity, torque fields etc. 

The results are strange, because they are slightly over the max, min bounds, OR even if there is a suitable result for the robot, then it is moving towards the target in a strange positions. For example it flips its wrists. I attached a picture, where I think the problem is clearly visible.


You can see by the ABB label on the robot (it has turned upside down), that the robot flipped its wrists for reaching the target.

%end


And there are also some cases where i think the target approaching for the robot should not be a problem, but there are no results for that target position.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/03/2021 15:06:12
My controller (specifically the ikmodule) contains algorithms to pick the best solution, so that there is no flipping of wrists etc (ikfast returns all possible solutions). It also checks for the bounds of the motors. You can easily adapt my code for other solvers. The comments should tell you how to do it. If you struggle, let me know.

##### vivip2231 11/03/2021 15:21:36
I adepted it without a problem, it's just after checking the bounds of the motors and masking all the possible solutions with that, it leaves me one solution but that is with flipping the wrists. If i go throught to pick out the solutions that includes flipping wrists ,then i am left with no result :/

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/03/2021 15:23:36
Just for a sanity check, you could disa le the joint limits and see if it works as intended.

##### vivip2231 11/03/2021 16:01:30
You mean go throught all  of the possible solutions? And see if one of them is a good one?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/03/2021 16:02:34
If you use my code, simply don't parse the bounds and change your proto so it does not have limits


Or do it via supervisor controller

##### vivip2231 11/03/2021 16:05:48
Okay i'll try that, and will inform about the   results

##### L4RG 11/04/2021 09:19:16
Good day, I have a simple question: I'm currently following tutorial 3 and have arrived at the step where I should add a texture to the ball ("red\_brick\_wall.jpg"). However, I cannot locate a worlds/textures directory on my PC. What's going on here? The worlds only contains a /sounds directory.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/04/2021 09:31:38
`@L4RG` Hi, you're right, looks like we forgot to update that part based on recent changes as the texture are no longer shipped but are instead downloaded when you need them. For the purpose of that tutorial you can:

- download it from here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2021b/projects/default/worlds/textures/red\_brick\_wall.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2021b/projects/default/worlds/textures/red_brick_wall.jpg) and add it from your local disk.

- use predefined PBRAppearances. To do this, remove the `ImageTexture` node you added to the `appearance` field, click the `appearance` field and press the "+" button. Under `PROTO nodes > appearances` you'll find plenty of options, among which `RedBrick`



Thanks for the report, I'll update the tutorial

##### vivip2231 11/04/2021 16:58:00
Update: I checked the min max positions, and changed them a little bit (some of them was not quite right), and now everything works fine! So I didnt had to delete the limits in the proto file. I have some solutions that are right. Now i have to pick the best one.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/04/2021 16:59:57
Awesome, glad to hear it. For picking the best solution I recommend my ikmodule. It also deals with singularities

##### bocchio 11/04/2021 17:14:22
Hi! I'm new to Webots. 

I was wondering if we are supposed to register `wb_supervisor_simulator_quit` to avoid crashing in an unexpected manner.

I'm working in C++ and I'm currently running a simulation that crashes once in a while.

But when it does, I end up with a bunch of QtWebEngineProcess zombie processes. But when I send SIGSTOP or quit the sim using the menu this doesn't happen.

Should there be code, handling whatever exception makes the sim crash, that calls `wb_supervisor_simulator_quit`?

I wanted to make sure we are supposed to call it manually

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/04/2021 17:21:44
`@bocchio` a memory leak in the handling of the textures occasionally lead to crashes as Webots ran out of memory (especially if you spawn and delete nodes very often). This is fixed in the nightly build of 2021b, you can try that version and see if it works better. If that isn't the case, do you have an idea about what might be triggering the crash? It would be better to find the cause and solve it instead, if it can be reproduced

##### bocchio 11/04/2021 17:59:37
`@DDaniel` Thanks for answering! 🙂 

Good to know! Sadly we are using 2021b already.

I couldn't find what's triggering the crash yet. I'll take a deeper look into it and report back in the coming days.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/04/2021 21:45:02
`@Majeedullah` The documentation is excellent and all the info is there. Here is some tips on how to get the info based on your example:

1. 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_basic\_time\_step](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_basic_time_step)

The link brings you to this section:



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/905936135975473152/unknown.png)
%end


Clicking on Worldinfo brings you here
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/905936531489955850/unknown.png)
%end


The first part shows you all the fields available for the worldinfo node. The entries are 'Field Type' 'Field name' 'default value' and 'value range / type'



As you can see, `basicTimeStep` is a float with the default value of 32 in the range of 1 to infinity


So if you want to find any default value for any node, look at the top of the documentation. Hope that helps 🙂

##### Justin Fisher [Moderator] 11/05/2021 00:28:40
I have an odd bug where a Webots track object occasionally disappears from the simulation (roughly once every 5 minutes of simulation runtime), and then causes Webots to crash-to-desktop if a robot aims an infrared sensor at the now-invisible track.  When it disappears, its `rotation` field becomes `[nan nan nan 0]`.  I have no idea what causes this problem, though I can tell that the track's `rotation` field drifts through a lot of different representations of an effectively null rotation as the simulation runs, so perhaps it eventually wanders itself into some sort of gimbal lock or something? 



I can get the track to reappear by clicking in the `rotation` field in the scene tree, and then clicking out of it again, which apparently triggers the scene tree interface to legalize whatever numbers (or not-a-numbers, in this case) were present there.  



I can also use a supervisor controller's super-omniscience to automatically detect when the track has disappeared by watching for when its `rotation` field starts to contain `nan`.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out any way to use supervisor powers to make the track reappear.  E.g., setting its `rotation` field back to `[0 1 0 0]` does not work, and instead leaves it with `nan`s.  



Is there any way a supervisor controller can trigger whatever the legalization-process is that clicking in and out of this field in the scene tree does?  Or some other other way that a supervisor could fix the fubared `rotation` field of a disappeared track?  Or better yet, some way to keep it from even disappearing in the first place?


I may have found a sort of solution.  If I have the supervisor periodically (once every 3 seconds) force the track back to its original `translation` and `rotation` that seems to keep the track from wandering far enough from this initial state to make itself disappear.  Or at any rate the problem hasn't repeated since I made this change (and it did repeat when I commented out this change), but the bug was rare and unpredictable enough that it's hard to tell whether it's really fixed or I just got lucky.



It's really annoying that track objects need to have physics enabled, so they become movable parts of the simulation itself.  It seems like there should have been an option to create fixed-location conveyer belts that move other things without themselves moving around, which probably would have solved the problem of this one wriggling itself around until it eventually finds an illegal rotation.  Of the many things I've done in Webots, this one conveyer belt has caused way more than its fair share of headaches!  (It also would keep settling into a location where it was hard for objects to exit the top of the belt, and robots get way worse traction on this conveyer than on normal surfaces, so it required a bunch of fiddling with contact properties.)

If you can provide a simplified simulation that demonstrates this crash (or divergence to nan coordinates) systematically, it would be nice to open an issue and upload your sample simulation so that we can investigate the problem.

##### D3cpt 11/05/2021 09:11:59
Hi, is it possible to print the simulation speed? Referring to "\_.\_x" beside the simulation time.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/05/2021 09:14:51
print where? You can run a simulation from command line using: `./webots --log-performance=filename.txt,1000 --mode=fast` and after running 1000 timesteps it will generate a report of the performance, including the average simulation speed

##### D3cpt 11/05/2021 09:16:10
while running because I am planning to run my script headless

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/05/2021 09:18:47
well, you can estimate it by taking the ratio between the simulated time (`wb_robot_get_time`) and the real elapsed time (using a classic time library)

##### D3cpt 11/05/2021 09:19:46
Thanks. i guess i can try `--log-performance` first

##### Ranga Kulathunga 11/05/2021 11:32:10
Hi, this is about the receiver object. The documentation says that if x is positive then the emitter should be on left and if x is negative then the emitter should be in right. But I got negative values for the x where the emitter is placed on the left. Z is also getting the opposite value.  Anyone can say why the reason for this sign change?

This is my simulation. The white one is the receiver while red one is emitter. Receiver prints the emitter direction. However, x and y get opposite sign values.

Hello, gents



Is there a way to sync up a RangeFinder and a Camera? The obvious way to make a 3D cam would be to create a Camera and a RangeFinder and to place them at the same origin. The issue is that those clearly use different buffers that are out of sync. That's not a problem if the camera is static, but if there is movement, you can't map between the image and the depth map.



Additional problem is that if the buffer is taken from some indeterminate point in the past, you can't reliably map the image to camera position without a timestamp.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/05/2021 13:32:20
`@Ranga Kulathunga` I just checked and it appears to be working as intended, is it perhaps that your emitter/receiver is turned? Something like this

##### D3cpt 11/05/2021 17:19:54
Hi, I was looking for ways to speed up my simulation and found that it runs on CPU. Is there a way to have it run on GPU to increase simulation speed?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/05/2021 17:36:14
Simulation speed depends on several factors:

- The capacity of your computer

- OpenGL settings and if you have shadows and anti-aliasing enabled

- How complex is your robot, the 3D model, the number of HingeJoins, the configuration of its 

 -boundingObject and physical part

- The configuration of the WorldInfo, that basicTimeStep and coulumbusFriction

- How complex is background and aggregate solids

- Controller code can also affect simulation speed.

I do not know if any other factor escapes me, but simplifying each of the previous ones I have achieved a higher simulation speed

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/05/2021 17:47:09
printing messages to console is a huge factor as well. Especially if you print sensor data every time step, which is somewhat common.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/05/2021 17:48:56
The physics is computed on the CPU and usually the limiting factor. Only visual based sensors such as cameras, lidars etc are accelerated with the gpu. So to increase your performance, the biggest impact can be achieved by increasing your step size and simplifying collision objects (use boxes and spheres instead of meshes for collision). Lastly try profiling your controller and see what portion of time the robot.step function takes up. That is the time the simulation takes. Having this in the 70-95% range means your controller is fast, if it is only 20% or so, your controller does slow things.

Yeah that's what I did, but I think the problem lie elsewhere


I'm doing some integrals and I think my dt is messed up because I have some time dilatation on my simulation (0.60x)


is there a way to get the time elapsed that take into consideration the time dilatation?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/06/2021 02:13:18
Maybe you need increase from mass of robot and / or change the mass center of it.


Have you record your simulation with showing acceleration value?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/06/2021 02:17:14
you have to use the simulation time, not real time. Calculate odometry every step and use the timestep (32ms or 16ms usually) as your dt

##### Grobis 11/06/2021 02:21:14
I've just tried using the getTime() method but I'm still having 10-15% error. I'll try to use the exact timestep as you suggest, it may be the issue

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/06/2021 02:22:44
some error can come from softCFM (soft collisions), where objects are allowed to penetrate each other a tiny bit. but that should not be on such a high magnitude


You also have to take the width of the tires into account. Approximating the distance between tires by their center line might not be 100% accurate. You can try and play with that value until it fits better

##### Grobis 11/06/2021 02:37:24
I'll give it a try, tyty

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/06/2021 03:04:19
I have a question. This penetrations are like calculations errors or like the deformation of collisions?

##### Grobis 11/06/2021 03:23:03
I'm having an issue that's driving me crazy, maybe folks more intelligent than me will see it imediately.

I have a robot which position is defined by (x,y,theta) and the speed by (vx, vy, vth)

If I'm moving forward, and let's say vx is equal to 0.1,  delta\_x = 0.1 * 1 * dt, so x will start incrementing (perfectly normal) 

Now let's say that I'm turning 180° so th = 3.14 , and still moving at the same speed, vx is now equal to -0.1.

so delta\_x = -0.1 * (-1) * dt, which means that delta\_x will also start incrementing but it should decrement.


```cpp
  double x = 0.0;
  double y = 0.0;
  double th = 0.0;

  double vx = 0.1;
  double vy = 0;
  double vth = 0;

  double dt = (current_time - last_time).toSec();
  double delta_x = (vx * cos(th) - vy * sin(th)) * dt;
  double delta_y = (vx * sin(th) + vy * cos(th)) * dt;
  double delta_th = vth * dt;

  x += delta_x;
  y += delta_y;
  th += delta\_th;
```

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/06/2021 03:45:34
If you turn 180 and drive BACKWARDS  (-0.1) instead of forward, x will still increment


You have to keep driving forward after turning

Is there a settings page on which the theme can be changed from "Webots Classic" to "Webots Dusk"?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/07/2021 09:53:42
you can change it in `tools > preferences > theme`


`@Uanuan` please ask the questions in the appropriate channels, not in news. Concerning your question, you can't use the BODY group because it contains things other than geometries alone (contains sensors and joints...). You can however have a group of different shapes for the `boundingObject`, for instance a shape for the body and 4 additional ones for the wheels. So your `boundingObject` can look something like:

```
boundingObject Group {
  children [
    Transform {
      translation ...
      children USE BODY1
    }
    Transform {
      translation ...
      children USE WHEEL1
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

##### Uanuan 11/08/2021 07:50:48
`@DDaniel` sorry about that, I just realized that I posted the question on news, my fault 😛


Thanks Daniel, I did something similar in the end: robot's children -> group -> group BODY then set robot's boundingField: BODY, and it works well in the simulation.

`@Max_K` The gravity always points in the U direction ENU stands for east, notrh, up which correspond to the xyz. you probably have to rotate your ground layer


if you want the y axis to be up, you have to use NUE (north up east)

if the objects are somewhat constant, you could load them once when starting but position them somewhere out of view, then just use the supervisor to move them in and out of the actual environment as you need them

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 02:54:16
I wanna control the door using a rotational motor...I have done all the steps of adding motor but for some reason when I provide the position it won't move (I am a total beginner in Webots so bear with me )


Someone pls do help

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/11/2021 02:56:39
You need to set a speed of your engine apart from the position.  All in radians

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:06:56
I did try setting the velocity alongside the position but still it didn't do anything

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:17:34
You don't have to set the speed. Just the position. Uncomment all speed settings. Make sure your angles are in radians and that you are actually setting the correct positions


You can also attach a void controller, double click on the robot and control the motors manually there

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:24:29
I did write a controller file and well followed a youtube tutorial the code went something like this



```py
from controller import Robot

robot = Robot()

timestep = 64


motor = robot.getDevice('rotational motor')
motor.setPosition(float('inf'))

While robot.step(timestep) != -1:
    motor.setPosition(1.5708)
```


Am I writing the code wrong or something? I did change the controller from void to my script

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:25:56
Uncomment the inf line, you also might want to get the joint position in the loop and print it

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:27:19
Ohh alright I removed the inf line but how do I get the joint position? Is there a predefined function for it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:27:57
Yes, look it up in the motor documentation

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:28:03
Alright

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:28:12
Or position sensor more like it

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:29:00
I did add position sensor as well to see the current position of the hinge to see whether the door is fully open or not


But my sensor doesn't work as well it just gives a constant value 🥲

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:31:44
Add a void Contoller, run the simulation and double click the robot

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:36:23
It's giving me something like this

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:36:59
Toggle overwrite controller, select the motor and change the position there

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:40:38
It still won't open the door just blinks nothing else happens

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:41:05
Then it is not the controller but your robot model


Something is set up wrong

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:44:56
The steps that I followed are 



1) Add door from the apartment structure



2) Transform it to base node



3) Again transform it to Robot



4) Get into children of door and add two distance sensor for sensing if a person is inside the room or not (again the sensor doesn't give any value except a constant 1000)



5) go to hingejoint and under devices add position sensor and rotational motor


This is how I setup the door

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:45:50
You have to make sure anchor position and the rotation axis are correct

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:47:44
Where can I check that? I can see something called rotation in door but not the anchor position

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:48:11
I'm on my phone, so I can't say

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:48:41
Ohh nvm it opened now when I deleted and added the door


Guess I must have done something to mess up the system of the door mechanics


The door works now even with the controller script but my distance sensor still aren't giving me any value except a constant 1000


Did I mess up the setting up the sensor as well?😅

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 03:58:16
Read the sensor documentation. All explained in there


Make sure you understand sensor type and lookup table

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 03:59:33
I did the documentation and understood most of it except the lookup table


Couldn't make a head or tail of it 😅

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 04:00:11
Try and read it again carefully

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 04:04:49
Alright


I understood now that 1000 means it's within 0.1m of my sensor hence the constant value but is there anyway that I can get a continuous change in value so that I can detect when the person is actually close to the door so that I can close/open the door as the bot moves out/in

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/11/2021 04:23:56
That you define in the lookup table, in the easiest setup you have a min and max range and a corresponding value for each, anything in between returns a interpolated value

##### Heartmage 11/11/2021 04:35:57
Ohh alright I thought lookup table was set in stone thanks again it has helped me a lot I will try out


So umm now everything works but for some reason my PS values are coming way different than what is expected


😅


It is expected to start from somewhere 0.007 to 0.009 and end at -1.57 to -1.40 but mine comes out to be -0.13 😅



PS means position sensor

Hey guys, 

I have been trying to load an old environment file which was created in V8.4.0 onto the latest version and am greeted with a very long list of errors (largely I assume due to the change in architecture) and a lot of missing textures. Is there a good way to convert these old files and controller to make them compatible with the newer versions?

##### Şükrü 11/11/2021 18:12:01
Hey guys, I have a robot vehicle BMW X5 and I'm trying to make an autonomous car. My console keeps spamming this warning:

WARNING: Robot > Speaker: Sound file 'sounds/engine.wav' not found. The sound file should be defined relatively to the controller, the PROTO or absolutely.

I couldn't solve it. It doesn't crash my controller and my code works fine but it makes my computer work slower. Can you help me out here?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/11/2021 18:46:00
if you don't care about sound, you can just set the `engineSound` field of the BMW to `""`


unfortunately not

##### Şükrü 11/11/2021 18:50:37
Thanks for the answer

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/11/2021 18:50:58
the motors that control the steering are named `left_steer` and `right_steer`, so you need to get the device tag (using `robot.getDevice("...")`), then just set the desired position as you do with any motor

##### AP\_LISC 11/11/2021 19:23:10

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 11/12/2021 11:20:05
Hi, I assume you install the package and did not build it from source, isn't it ?



This example depends on `ros2_control` which has been recently modified.



Thus for `Foxy` the released package `webots_ros2` is not yet ready to handle those modifications on  `ros2_control`. It will come in the next Sync.



One way to handle this would be to use `Foxy testing` but you can also wait for the sync.

##### nozomi 11/12/2021 11:27:42
Yep, i install by package and the answer is quite clear to me. Thanks a lot for your help!

You enabled the receiver with a sampling period of 10 seconds, is that intended? Also, did you try to put the reception on a loop?

Inside the loop you should check the queue length, when it becomes non zero you read  the data

the manual should pretty much be the same


`@killer_2` can you post a screenshot and perhaps sensor values of your issue?


and were you using a distance sensor in infrared mode?


`@Stevennc` your issue is more a fundamental python programming issue. You call functions without storing their return values in variables. I made a quick working controller. It assumes that you have 2 robots, named `'robot_1'` and` 'robot_2'`, both with a receiver and emitter. The same controller can be run on both.

I'm getting a linker error when trying to make one of my controllers


I'm for the most part using the standard makefile, and I just split up my controller into two files


Where the first one is including the header file of the second


But it seems like the gcc command isn't attempting to link the cpp file of the second, and so the linker isn't finding any of the functions in the second file


Any ideas?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/13/2021 03:13:34
This sounds like a general c compiler problem, not a webots problem. Google the console error output

##### Zev 11/13/2021 03:14:58

right, the gcc command doesn't link the files, and I don't know how to edit the gcc command

Yes, they are on a black background.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/13/2021 04:23:29
do white background and a black line


or a grey line


white will give you the same as red

##### killer\_2 11/13/2021 04:24:37
I cannot change the color of lines. Robot MUST follow white line on a black background and change direction when it detect a red line.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/13/2021 04:24:53
well then infrared is not the way to go


you cant change the world or line color?

##### killer\_2 11/13/2021 04:26:53
Neither.

I can change colors for testing purposes. 



But the final task has to be completed in the given world, which has white, red lines on black background.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/13/2021 04:27:49
then seperate the tasks, have the line following behavior, and then use a different sensor to detect the color

##### killer\_2 11/13/2021 04:28:27

Hello guys, is it still true that it's not possible to use appearance with ImageTexture for Shape with Mesh geometry? I have found some mentions in this Discord in the past, I see nothing about it in the documentation and I have found one particular file `pen_mesh.wbt` in tests in GitHub repo which contains such a situation but unfortunately the world file does not work at all (the mesh and the controller are missing).


Ok, now I see that it somehow works with OBJ file, but not with STL file. Is that right? When I convert this STL file to IndexFaceSet, then the texture can be applied, or at least I think that it can.


After further research I understand that I can't use textures with STL mesh. I knew this probably all the time but I had an object in Webots from the past that was textured (and IndexedFacieSet) and I was convinced that this object was created by File - Import 3D mesh from STL file. Obviously, it wasn't!


But then there is a new problem. I have an OBJ file exported from Blender that contains UV mapping and I have a PNG file with the texture. For example, in MeshLab this shows ok and the texture is applied correctly. But in Webots when I use Mesh node with ImageTexture, the texture is applied in a wrong way, it's shifted. When I use File - Import 3D mesh on this OBJ file and create IndexedFaceSet from it and apply ImageTexture to this ImageFaceSet, it shows correctly. Am I doing something wrong or is there a bug?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/17/2021 13:49:19
If it looks right when using the import button, you can right-click and select `Export` in order to export it as `.wbo`. When you open this wbo file, does the `shape > appearance` is the same as what you set up when doing it manually?

##### jmarsik 11/17/2021 13:51:16
When using the import function, the mesh is imported as IndexedFaceSet ... and textures seem to work with this variant. They do not work with Mesh geometry node.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/17/2021 13:52:10
can you provide the obj?

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:22:35
Hello everyone, somebody knows how to know the direction of the robot? I mean, how can I get a vector of the robot?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:26:57
Where is your robot moving?  That's what you mean?

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:27:49
Yes, I need to set a goal but I need to calculate an angle between two vectors (I think). If there is another way please tell me to


The idea is that the robot get the direction of the goal

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:29:52
Exist some ways to do this, one is thru Supervisor and other is using GPS

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:30:15
I use the supervisor. I don't have GPS in turtlebot3


I was trying to understand .getOrientation and getPose, but I don't know exactly how to use it

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:37:46
You only need know the translation vector of your robot

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:38:06
And how can I get that?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/17/2021 15:42:17
```
robot_node = robot.getFromDef('DEF_NAME_OF_MY_ROBOT')
position = robot_node.getPosition()
```

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:44:05
But that's only the point, right?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:44:57
Yes.


\# create the Robot instance.

robot = Supervisor()



robotNode = robot.getSelf()





    # Get Position

    position\_robot = robotNode.getPosition()

    

    # Position Module (x, y, z)

    x\_position = position\_robot[0]

    y\_position = position\_robot[1]

    z\_position = position\_robot[2]

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:47:39
But how I get the direction there?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:48:46
The position\_robot is a vector placed in an array

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:49:07
Because the robot has to reach a goal. So what I'm thinking, is I have to calculate angle between two vector and then rotate the robot until angle is almost 0. Then go straight

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:49:42
You can use trigonometry to operate vectors and obtain the direction

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:50:15
Yes, so you are saying that I use the center (0,0,0) as reference right?

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:51:31
Only you need the origin vector and goal vector to determine the direction


Both using the same reference

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:52:43
But I don't understand that. Because even If my robot is in (2,0,1) you don't know where the robot is moving, you just have the vector of the center to the robot but don't have direction of the robot's moving


You don't know where the velocity is pointing

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/17/2021 15:56:08
You need to know what values ​​of x, y, z change.  You must compare the current position with the previous one.


You can get the velocity with Supervisor too

##### ykopoblete 11/17/2021 15:58:28
Thank you!

Hello all, im using a turtlebot3 for self driving in a maze, im currently facing 2 problems. 1. i cant get the robot to turn 90 degrees reliably, i tried using position sensors(to calculate the exact distance to travel for a 90 degree turn) at some turns it turns correctly at some turns it dosent also tried using a compass to stop the wheels but at the start of the turn the compass gives odd readings throwing me out of the running loop  2. i also want to maintain a specific distance from the wall while travelling in a straight line, i have attached 2 distance sensors on the side but not sure what feedback loop i should create for it. Thanks for the help in advance.


Also, what is the simplest way to map the environment in webots without using ROS or anything fancy?

##### jmarsik 11/17/2021 20:07:12
Not this one, but I can try to use another one to see if there will be the same problem.


I have also discovered, that Shapes with mesh geometry node probably cannot be used as a bounding object (with DEF USE mechanism) 😦

I am trying to automate the door using position sensor ,rotational sensor and motor 

with a python controller 

Please help

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/18/2021 20:05:31
Can you give us more detail? How do you control the 180° turn? Do you use odometry, or another method for pose estimation? Perhaps you can record a quick video (inside webots) to show the issue


Using the position of the wheels alone is not always 100% correct, because the wheels are not infinitesimally thin and thus must slip. Using the compass or another sensor for precise orientation reading is a good way to do it. Can you elaborate as to why or how the compass readings are odd? Are you using atan2(x, y) to calculate the angle? And are you taking value jump from -pi to pi (or pi to -pi) into account?


can you share your whole code or even the project? Seeing this function I see 2 potential issues:

1. Is the` children`  WbFieldRef  defined before calling it in the loop? 

2. Is  object.wbo in the correct directory? According to the documentation it is relative to the controller itself. Just for testing you could try the absolute path and switch it back to relative when it works


can you share your whole project? I can take a look. Or at least post the whole python controller (just drag & drop the file)


If you want to get the direction of your robot, you should use `robot_node.getOrientation()` This gives you the 3x3 rotation matrix. Then it is just a simple case of linear algebra to transform it into any kind of information you want. If you are not 100% sure what these different notations mean, take a look at this website:

[https://www.andre-gaschler.com/rotationconverter/](https://www.andre-gaschler.com/rotationconverter/)

And to easily convert from one orientation notation to another use this library

[https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/](https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/)

it allows for quick and easy transformation from matrix -> euler -> quaternion -> axangles etc.



You can also calculate the direction vector directly. To do this, you do the following steps:

1. define you direction vector in the robot coordinate system (e.g. the x-axis of your robot would be [1, 0, 0], the y-axis [0, 1, 0])

2. Dot product your robot vector with the rot matrix to get the direction vector in world coords


it would look something like this. I did not test it, so let me know if there is an issue

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 11/19/2021 09:01:45
Hey guys. I'm trying to model a 4-wheeled car. Therefore I've looked how the example cars (bmw/toyota etc) are modelled. Since our real car has no brakes, I would use the AckermannVehicle as base . But when i add this to the world, I get `WARNING: AckermannVehicle (PROTO) > Transform > DEF LEFT_STEER_HINGE2 Hinge2Joint: Hinge2Joint nodes can only connect Solid nodes that have a Physics node.` (2 times for RIGHT / LEFT steer). This exception I also get when adding the Car.proto or SimpleVehicle.

I would expect that the provided proto demos would work without any warnings. When I start the simulation with those, the rear wheels are not moving while front wheels are turning around the UP-Axis.



Any hints what I have to modify to remove those warnings and fix the strange turning bevhaior of the wheels?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/19/2021 09:08:04
AckermannVehicle is an abstract PROTO, you need to specify the Physics node for the warning to disappear

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 11/19/2021 09:12:06
Alright, thanks. I will give it a try.

And another question. I've seen that there are separated controllers for autonomous driving (driver & car). What are the requirements to use them? For example, does the car controller work only when I use the car proto but not when using the ackermannVehicle or can I use them independed of the base proto (but may requires specific names of devices)?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/19/2021 09:20:39
The Car proto inherits from AckermannVehicle and adds extra fields. To be able to use all methods from the libraries, you'd need to base your design on the Car PROTO, not Ackermann. The driver library allows to control what a normal driver would have access too (steering wheel, pedals, ...) and the car library is about getting information about the state of the car (wheel steering angle, wheel radius, ...), so usually you use both


or alternatively you don't use the libraries at all and instead you can get references to the motors/sensors and control them as you would control any other robot

##### Rico Schillings[Sweaty] [Moderator] 11/19/2021 09:27:01
Ok. At the moment I have modelled the car based on the robot caus I had some problems with the Car/Ackerman protos. As already said, I will give it a new try with these protos and will see if I use these libraries or work further with the generic robot as base. Thanks again for the quick and detailed answer 🙂

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/19/2021 16:58:56
It's indeed quite odd, I have the same issue as you mentioned, however if I:

- save the IndexedFaceSet-based version of the object into a PROTO file

- then convert this PROTO from IndexedFaceSet to a Mesh using this script: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/scripts/proto\_splitter/proto2mesh.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/scripts/proto_splitter/proto2mesh.py)

- load the resulting mesh (using a `Mesh` node), the texture looks right



Needs to be investigated further

##### jmarsik 11/19/2021 18:53:36
Ok, that is interesting! I did not know about this script. However of course it means more work that is probably hard to automate (the Import 3D model command) 😦 Should I create a GitHub issue for this? I do not have enough knowledge to pursue the issue myself, but maybe someone will try?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/19/2021 19:35:18
Yes, it's good to report it on github with the example file you posted here so that we can take a closer look into it, something might indeed be wrong, what exactly I'm not sure. Thank you

##### Rizalfauz 11/21/2021 03:42:16
Hello everyone, I'm using ROS as controller. Can supervisor show realtime value of robot position ?

##### Yannnick3 [Cyberbotics] 11/21/2021 11:50:48
If you get the rotation field of the robot from the supervisor in the axis-angle format, you should not only look at the angle value but also the sign of the vertical axis. Depending on the rotation change of your robot, it can happen that the coordinate system gets flipped upside-down. The correct angle in the coordinate system is therefore (sign of the vertical axis)*(angle value).  Angles are given between -pi and +pi, zero means that the robot is aligned with the front axis. From there, turning clockwise gives you a negative angle and counter-clockwise a positive angle. You could simply use a proportional controller to align your robot with the desired orientation.

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 11/22/2021 07:29:27
Is your situation with ROS2 ?

In that case you might use a plugin for your supervisor ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-Creating-a-Custom-Python-Plugin](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-Creating-a-Custom-Python-Plugin)) and then use `self.__my_robot = self.__robot.getFromDef(DEF_NAME_MY_ROBOT)` to get the reference of your robot and `position = self.__my_robot.getPosition()`

##### Timple 11/22/2021 10:50:07

Hello everyone! I'm working on a PID controller for the line following robot and I've got some problems like the robot drop-off the floor during the simulation (this makes the sensors give me the wrong values).

I’m using the basicTimestep of 32. (the given problem can be fixed with the basicTimestep of 8 but I don’t have right to change the world.info directly).

So I’m working on the supervisor to fix this. Do you guys have any ideas for the supervisor on this problem?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/23/2021 00:50:10
`@tomiio6` if it is an assignment and you are not allowed to change the timestep, doing so with a supervisor is cheating. And changing the timestep in a running simulation is not advisable anyways


There seems to be other issues, even with 32ms timestep, the robot should not sink into the floor like that

##### tomiio6 11/23/2021 01:15:59
the assignment was given with a supervisor TRUE so I'm able to do something with supervisor.  Could you help me why the robot sink into the floor like that with my world file?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/23/2021 01:17:12
Often it is due to the mass being way too high, or softcfm value being too high in the worldinfo. Also the bounding objects have to be simple geometry, not meshes

##### tomiio6 11/23/2021 01:18:50
Well then those are the things that I'm not able to modify. Can I do something with the code to fix this?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/23/2021 01:19:08
if you share your project, i can take a look


whole directory, so i can just run it


are you allowed to change the robot?

##### tomiio6 11/23/2021 01:22:55
No. Just the code

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/23/2021 01:32:01
I dont see any red flags, the mesh is a bit too complex, but that is just visual. The acceleration and speed is very high (around 1g), with larger physics steps, this can cause issues. So my main advice would be to try and lower the top speed and / or the acceleration.


the motors have 10Nm torque, that seems a bit high (it could lift 1kg on a 1m lever). So going 100% will probably cause issues

##### tomiio6 11/23/2021 01:35:45
So what is the maximum speed I could use?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/23/2021 01:37:38
try things out yourself. you can change the maxtorque  in your controller, and for maxspeed you can just multiply your current velocity (1000) with a scaling factor such as 0.6 and just experiment


The latter might be enough for the start

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/23/2021 03:20:37
you can send commands from one controller to the other with emitter / receiver

##### DFmaster 11/23/2021 03:22:53
do you have an example of the emitter/receiver? im working with python for that

##### L4RG 11/23/2021 13:43:43
Good day everyone,

I have a modeling question about how to best represent a plant in Webots.



The plant is a data-based, discrete state-space/transfer function in Matlab. This plant is part of a simple feedback loop with a Simulink autotuned PID-controller. The discrete control loop in Matlab contains a typical PID-calculation setup, with a reference (position curve), PID-output u[k] and plant output y[k] based on state-space calculations.



The real-life plant can be compared to a belt moving along 1 axis, so translating a reference position input to an output which can read by a linear encoder.



To model this plant, I want to use a Track setup with a **LinearMotor** and **PositionSensor**. Ideally, I want to feed the Matlab PID-output u[k] as an input to the LinearMotor and read the corresponding position from PositionSensor after some time. The transfer function / state-space should determine the behavior of this setup, not the built-in **controlPID** variable contained in the LinearMotor.



Does anyone have any experience with a similar setup? How can I best model/simulate the system that I described, where the PID-controller itself runs in the Matlab script? Thank you in advance!



edit: I can provide more details if required.

Hi, is there an easy way to turn a matplotlib into a display overlay in webots?


Alternatively, how can I print a numpy array as an image?

##### Shastro 11/24/2021 05:51:07
Hello I am not sure if this is the best place to ask this but I have been having an issue with webots\_ros on Ubuntu 20.04 with ros-noetic and Webots R2021b. 



When trying to enable a lidar sensor using `rosservice call /david_10968_15IMH05H/Velodyne_Puck/enable 32 `

I recieve the error: 

```Error: wb_lidar_get_layer_range_image() called for a disabled device! Please use: wb_lidar_enable().
WARNING: 'ros' controller crashed. 
```



After extensive research I have learned that some people may have been able to resolve this issue by using the webots\_ros version on the  **develop** branch and building from source. However after trying this (as well as other branches) I have not been able to find a version of webots\_ros that uses the updated API.

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 11/24/2021 07:41:43
On my side I can do it with `master` branch of `webots_ros`. Did you try this branch?

##### Shastro 11/24/2021 08:21:05
Hmm, I believe I did, but I will double check. To test this I have just been remaking the catkin\_workspace and sourcing ./devel/setup.bash. Is there something I am missing to make sure everything is using the webots\_ros I think it is? Thank you very much for this help!

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 11/24/2021 08:28:45
I believe this is a known bug:

##### JosjaG 11/24/2021 16:15:55
Hi everyone, 

I have an issue getting a gripper to work properly in webots, and I was hoping someone could help me in the right direction. 

The gripper has two fingers and one motor, and the two fingers are mechanically coupled. I currently implemented the two fingers as HingeJoints with one coupled motor. In that implementation, sending gripper goals works, but collisions are not handled correctly as the fingers are not mechnically linked. Does anyone know of an example for such a situation to help me in the right direction?


I fixed it by heavily increasing the maxTorque of the motor, which feels like a hacky solution so if anyone has any suggestions for a cleaner solution, please let me know!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 11/24/2021 17:48:03
did you take a look at the example world `coupled_motors` under `file > open sample world`, seems to be what you're looking for

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 11/25/2021 07:23:10
Thanks Daniel! Finally I managed to make a robot gripper work, with a parallelogram mechanism, an excellent example, I had already seen it but could not understand it. To be honest it seems like a puzzle. but it contains the concept of motor coupling, physics, relative solids and direction of rotation (multiplier)

##### Venkat 11/25/2021 08:11:22
I am trying to control two different robots and two linear motors sequentially in a project. For each robot and the linear motors, I tried "extern" controllers. For a sequential process execution, I am trying to invoke the controllers from an external bash script, where my intention is to run robots sequentially. For example, robot1->task1; after task1 complete->robot2->task2. But with extern controllers, I dont know how to achieve this, since the "extern" controllers that was invoked doesnt run as the other extern controllers arent invoked. With robot1 performing task1, I want robot2 to be idle and so on. Also I would like to know if I can use supervisor for the whole system, and based on robot names, can I assign the respective task (again seqentially). Thanks.

##### Sebek 11/25/2021 11:03:45
Hello everyone,

I have a question about adding your own source and header files in C programms. I wanted to seperate all used functions that 

I made from main file so the code would be easier to read/use. For example in main.c i have: 

int func1();

int func2();



int main(){

\#\# some code

}



int func1(){

\#\# some code

}

int func2(){

\#\# some code

}

And i want to move func1() and func2() to other source files. So 

I made something like this:

main.c:

\#include "Functions.h"

int main(){

\#\# some code

}



Functions.h:

int func1();

int func2();



Functions.c:

\#include "Functions.h"

int func1(){

\#\# some code

}

int func2(){

\#\# some code

}

I know that i also have to edit makefile, but after reading documentation i dont understand how exactly. I tried to add C\_SOURCES and external libraries (INCLUDE, LIBRARIES) but it didnt work. I  couldnt find any example project in internet to check how its properly done so Im asking here. Can someone explain me and/or show how to do that? Thanks in advance!

##### sprootkit 11/25/2021 15:47:12
Greetings,



I have a proto with a hinge joint. If I stack several of those together (via endpoints), Webots freezes during "processing nodes" loading step. What's going on?



```PROTO TorqueSensor [
    ...
    field SFNode        endpoint            NULL
]
{
    Solid {
        ...

                rotation                0 1 0 0

How it's used. There is also a similar proto with a slider joint - those stack without issues.

        motor_name  "TorqueSensorY_motor"
        name        "torque sensor y"
        endpoint TorqueSensor{
            axis        0 -1 0
            pos_name    "TorqueSensorZ_pos"

Can I directly set the position of a motor to designated value using Supervisor?

##### Mat198 11/26/2021 00:42:36
Position in space or the motor angle?

##### SeanLuTW 11/26/2021 00:43:01
Motor angle

##### Mat198 11/26/2021 00:47:09
There is no need to use the supervisor

##### SeanLuTW 11/26/2021 00:52:50
If using `Motor.setPosition()`, the angle of the motor will rotate to the target angle steply like a real motor, while what I want is to neglect the physics simulation and directly make the angle of the motor to the target value.

##### Mat198 11/26/2021 01:01:42
Got it. Never did that. My suggestion is to use an solid and just set the orientation with supervisor

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/26/2021 03:11:43
`@brownie` you should probably use anaconda for python

##### brownie 11/26/2021 03:19:32
cool, just trying that now. Playing the simulation with a python controller gives the following dlopen error `dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/_c_internal_utils.cpython-38-darwin.so, 0x0002): tried: '/Users/umar/Developer/School/Robotics/CSCI3302_Lab5/CSCI3302_Lab5/controllers/lab5_controller/_c_internal_utils.cpython-38-darwin.so' (no such file), '/Applications/Webots.app/lib/controller/_c_internal_utils.cpython-38-darwin.so' (no such file), '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/_c_internal_utils.cpython-38-darwin.so' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'arm64', need 'x86_64')), '/usr/lib/_c_internal_utils.cpython-38-darwin.so' (no such file)`

you gonna have to google / duck that. But it seems like you are trying to use a x86 compiled file under arm or vice versa

yeah so far haven't found anything for it unfortunately. have no clue where its compiled as x86 other than webots itself :(

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/26/2021 03:24:17
I have no experience with arm and macs, but maybe you should run everything in rosetta and x86

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/26/2021 03:28:36
I have no idea how mac and arm works, but perhaps it is possible to have a linux vm running in macOS, like wsl2 in windows.

##### brownie 11/26/2021 03:32:02
that might work, unsure how itll handle the RAM though, if linux can even be VM'ed that well at the moment

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 11/26/2021 03:33:04
I have no idea. Apple silicon and arm is quite new still, so it will most likely remain a constant struggle when developing for a while

##### TurnDownForWhat 11/26/2021 12:02:41
`@Justin Fisher`  Hello! If I've understood correctly, I am having the same issues as you with importing from a different package. Basically, I wanna import a class from a sister folder. In my IDE, it accepts me importing the class, however when I run it in Webots I get a NoModuleFoundError. 

If I list all of my modules in python running on a "normal" terminal, I can find my package in the list of modules (by running "help('modules')"), but when I run it on the controller to get the outputs in the Webots terminal, it doesn't find it there. Anyways, I am trying to use a ini file as you do here, but I don't think I'm using it correct


If anyone else would happen to know a solution, that would be great! What I am trying to achieve, is to be able to import "moose\_simpleactions\_generator.py" to my controllers, currently I am trying with this structure, because of this description: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming?tab-language=python#shared-libraries](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming?tab-language=python#shared-libraries)

Hi. I'm new at webots and previously, i havent used any robotic simulator before. I wonder how can i do performance test on webots. For example position accuracy of mobile robot or its torque etc?

##### Mat198 11/26/2021 15:22:29
You need to be more specific about what you wanna do. Are you doing position control of the wheels? To simulate the torque you need to set the friction force related to the ground and the motors parameters.

##### AP\_LISC 11/27/2021 17:08:17
I am writing some code to control a robot such that it turns 90 degrees when it sees an obstacle and I noticed that the way the robot rotation angle is represented ( measured clockwise or counter clockwise) seems to be varying at about 180 degrees. Is there a way to force the measurement to be one way or another?

##### jmarsik 11/27/2021 18:02:28
What is the best approach to debug Webots hang in a complicated scenario (or maybe it isn't?) - we have a simulation with 2 ROS2 external controllers (each in separate ROS2 Python node), 1 Python3 controller running in Webots. All controllers are running synchronized. The simulation runs ok for a moment and then hangs. Webots are still responsive to UI actions, but the time is stopped. But when we do very extensive logging from the main ROS2 controller (that is actually doing something, the other is just calling `supervisor.step(...)` in a loop) we do not see anything that would mean that the hang is happening in the ROS2 code. It looks like that `robot.step(...)` is called and never returns.



It happens only on my colleague's computer, not on my computer and not on other 2 computers that I have tried.



I see that the `--disable-gpu` option is probably no longer available (to determine if the hang is caused by some problem with rendering).



Would you use `gdb` to look into the ROS2 Python node and see if it is waiting in a libcontroller call? And then `gdb` on Webots itself to see if it is waiting somewhere?

##### R\_ 11/27/2021 18:40:02
does Webots have an option that just runs the simulation directly from code without the GUI? For example, pybullet does this:



```
import pybullet as p
p.connect(p.GUI)
```

This opens a window with out any GUI stuff

##### jmarsik 11/27/2021 19:00:43
I'm starting to think that it could be related to some timeout happening in the communication between libController (on ROS2 node side) and Webots main process. Is there anything like this in the implementation? I have discovered that when I pause the ROS2 node through GDB and then resume it again after a few minutes, it behaves exactly the same - time in Webots stops, Webots are responsive to UI actions, ROS2 external controller waits in robot.step(...). When I reset the simulation, the ROS2 node is killed and respawns (we have it set that way), normally it would "connect" again to the simulation and everything will start again, but not in this case - again the time is stopped at 0:00:00:000.


Hmm, but it does not happen always 😦

I am trying to get the distance between an emitter and a receiver, according to documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver?version=develop&tab-language=python#:~:text=The%20wb\_receiver\_get\_signal\_strength](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver?version=develop&tab-language=python#:~:text=The%20wb_receiver_get_signal_strength)  the signal strength = 1/ (distance^2). So, I can get the distance doing Distance = sqrt(1/signal). but I am having the wrong values. in a triangle where x=2m, y=0m and z=2m I get a distance of 1.26 meters. My calculation is correct? I am doing something wrong. emitter and infrared are infrared signals, with aperture and range at -1. In advance thank you very much.

##### Dnumgis 12/02/2021 16:25:43
should be distance = 1/sqrt(signal)?

##### fabricio 12/02/2021 16:28:39
the result is the same


the distance should be 2.82 and I am getting 1.26 meters

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/02/2021 20:04:59
Can you share your project? So we can take a look


or the code. It works absolutely fine for me


take a look at this sample project. The calculation works. Hope this helps. It includes a infrared and radio test world

the only thing I can see at a glance is that you are not publishing the correct rotation for finger\_mounting. This is assuming, that line 28 in your code is that transform. Also make sure you selected 'world' as the reference in rviz

##### SeanLuTW 12/03/2021 01:39:51
Hi I am using a cuboid with a touch sensor to test collision with built-in conveyor (`ConveyorBelt`), and I found that the border will trigger the sensor while the belt won't. I took a look at the PROTO and found that the `Track` has defined `boundingObject`, but why it doesn't trigger the sensor?

##### Ian Lau 12/03/2021 01:50:36
Thanks for reply. Actually the robot is static instead of rotation. It will happen when the robot is stationary in place for a period of time. Is it possible to have some cumulative errors in lidar calculations?


`@Olivier Michel`

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/03/2021 07:34:47
No, lidar calculation should be computed each time the sensor is refreshed.

##### NobodyImportant 12/03/2021 10:17:53
I can only say that I have simillar lidar problem. I thought that I made some mistake because I work over ros1, and I visualize my cloud over rviz. My robot is stationary too, and its parallel to the vertical wooden tile. First 2 min is all good but Later, I saw that robot is no more parallel to the wooden tile in rviz. 😅

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/03/2021 10:27:44
It could be that the lidar is not properly enabled. Please check the code of the sample lidar demo to find our where the problem might be in your controller code.

##### Ian Lau 12/03/2021 10:46:12
But the picture I posed is captured from the sample lidar demo.😅

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/03/2021 11:01:49
I just tried the sample lidar demo and it works as expected. Please that this is a rotating lidar, so it takes time to the rotating head to sample all the points. If the robot is spinning at the same time, you get what you posted on your screenshot.

##### Ian Lau 12/03/2021 11:10:23
🤔 But the robot is stationary.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/03/2021 11:14:11
In the demo it's moving, did you change the controller to make it stationnary?

You should upgrade to version R2021b where some lidar bug has been fixed.

##### Ian Lau 12/03/2021 11:54:34
The 2021b version doesn't have some offline material resources, and sometimes the download wasn't successful, so I chose the 2021a version


Is it possible that there will be these full offline resources in future releases?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/03/2021 11:55:49
We have no plans for this.

Hello, I need some advice for my Webots R2021b. I've created my own 2-wheels robots. I've added two HingeJoints, RotationalMotors to their device node and endPoint Solid Physics and boundingObjects for the wheels. Everything works well, robot moves but in the oposite direction :-)** How can I change rotation direction of motors or do something else to have robot moving in the intended direction, please**? (Of course I know I can set negative values for velocity in the controller but it is not a good solution for me...) Thank you for any advices!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/04/2021 11:26:45
Invert the axis parameter of the hingejoint. If it's 1 0 0, set -1 0 0


under `file > open sample world > obstacle_avoidance.wbt` there's an example of the Thymio avoiding obstacles. You can access the distance sensors in the same manner.


you would need to install the webots development environment and recompile webots if you change that. I don't see the point of going that far. You can control the motors in torque directly from a normal controller, doing so bypasses the PID controller

##### jirka 12/04/2021 12:13:03
Great, it works like a charm. Thank you!!!


Hello, I've still one problem... If I open the sample Koala (K-team) project with the Breitenberg controller, everything works well.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 12/06/2021 12:36:47
If the hinge joint doesn't have a position sensor then you need to specify it in the `joint_state_broadcaster`, see here:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/c1b3a055f9b3d931066083e561c3dbee5b386c3a/webots\_ros2\_tiago/resource/ros2\_control.yml#L22-L35](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/c1b3a055f9b3d931066083e561c3dbee5b386c3a/webots_ros2_tiago/resource/ros2_control.yml#L22-L35)



`joint_state_broadcaster` publishes joint positions and `robot_state_publisher` takes it (together with URDF) and publishes a transform tree. If a position of a joint is not known then `robot_state_publisher` cannot publish the full transform tree.


There is a `get_pose` service:

Hey guys,



I want to provide visual information of kinect to the nao robot. I add the kinect node which wrapped by robot node  to the headslot of nao node . In my webots project, nao has his controler（naoqisim）and kinect has his controller（kinect\_controller) too. But when I run the kinect \_controller to control kinect getting the visual information, the kinect will drop from the nao head. Is there a way to fixed the kinect on the nao head on the condition that nao and kinect have their own controller. I have to use two controllers to control nao and kinect, respectively. Because I need the official controller (naoqisim) to control nao robot. The official controller can not be program to control the kinect.

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 12/07/2021 17:25:24
I do not think you will found this behaviour directly in Webots, you will have to program it with some kind of odometry (for example I think your Thymio is following a trail and you have several patches with different colors so you could use this feature to know where your thymio is).

By memory, in the samples this world might be doing something similar to what you are trying (`file > open sample world > force_control.wbt`), but don't remember exactly


Can you share the controller?

##### Sadat 12/10/2021 17:40:13
Yes

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 17:40:49
Actually you are mixing c and python in the image you provided


The Python one is `pen.setInkColor(...)`


Yes


`write`, not `Write`


Did you add a Pen node to the children field of the robot?

##### Sadat 12/10/2021 17:53:14
Now i added, still something off

the path he went and drew nothing..


The surface is paintable, set to true, even set the color, nothing works


density 1, inkEvaporation 0


I don't know what else i can do


I think there might be a bug in Pen lib with python

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 18:26:00
Did you change the size of the arena? If so you need to adapt the `floorTileSize` parameter in the same way. This proto doesn't adjust the texture mapping on its own, I think this had conflicts with the pen

##### Sadat 12/10/2021 18:27:41
I mean.. I created my own arena

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 18:28:44
But the floor is a RectangleArena no?

##### Sadat 12/10/2021 18:29:23
Yeah


it is RectangleArena

Try making floorTileSize to 2 2


Is the pen mark visible?

##### Natsdon 12/10/2021 18:30:57
Question : by setting a global variable within a function can it still be defined ?


or is it better suited that i define outside of a function ?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 18:54:09
Just adding to the slot is not sufficient, you need to orient the pen towards the ground


The pen node writes along the -Y


If you add it to the groundSlot that means setting a rotation of `0 0 1 1.5708`

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/10/2021 19:02:31
Any idea about this?

##### Sadat 12/10/2021 19:03:28
`@DDaniel` Thank you


Finally

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 19:12:30
The variable of your distance sensor is called `left_ground`, ds isnt defined anywhere (there is one but commented)


Is it a custom world or also happens with the ones in the samples? Which OS?

##### Natsdon 12/10/2021 19:15:45
that uncommented one was placed there when i opened this controller for the first time, should i uncomment it and place it within one of my functions ?

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/10/2021 19:19:05
It is a custom world and a very simple one. straight road with 2 lanes. SUMO is run with my other examples but not with this one. Win10 is the OS.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 19:21:24
Have you tried selecting a different port in the SumoInterface?

##### Natsdon 12/10/2021 19:21:41
I thought i added the sensors in via gs.append and ds.append ( my understanding is that they get added to gs = [] and ds = [])

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/10/2021 19:23:12
I have not an idea about what the possible ports are. Is it possible to change?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/10/2021 19:23:56
Yes but the sensor function isn't called, in the main loop it's commented as well


Try 8874

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/10/2021 19:24:57
I tried that but not work.

##### Şükrü 12/11/2021 11:15:08
Hey guys, I'm trying to install Webots nightly version on Ubuntu. I downloaded the tar.bz2 file but I couldn't find how to install it. Can you help me here?

##### Benjamin Hug [Moderator] 12/11/2021 14:01:24
It is a compressed file, just extract it. The executable is at the root of the folder and you should be able to launch Webots with `./webots`.

##### Şükrü 12/13/2021 12:11:22
Thanks that works, the version I'm currently using is 2021b rev1 nightly build 9/12/2021. I'm trying to work with point clouds using python-pcl library. I have successfully downloaded and imported it and it works but some of the filters makes Webots crash. It says "The process crashed some time after starting successfully.".  I'm not doing anything complex. This is the part of code that causing crash:

p = pcl.load("point\_cloud.pcd")

outrem = p.make\_RadiusOutlierRemoval()

outrem.set\_radius\_search(0.4)

outrem.set\_MinNeighborsInRadius(2)

p = outrem.filter()

    

visual = pcl.pcl\_visualization.CloudViewing()

visual.ShowMonochromeCloud(p, b'cloud')

##### Robokashi 12/14/2021 21:07:37
Hey guys, is the webots\_ros2 package tested under Windows ? I spent the last day trying to make it work but I encounter issues (especially with the robot\_launch.py file, I get an error that spawner.py cannot be found whereas I see it clearly in the install/controller\_manager folder xD).


I tried it on Foxy and Galactic.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/15/2021 09:10:54
Yes, it should work. We are publishing a new tutorial on how to get started with Webots and ROS 2. The tutorial was tested and works fine on Windows (in addition to Linux). It is currently being merged to the Rolling documentation, but works with both Foxy and Galactic and will be merged with the respective documentation soon. You will find the PR about it here: [https://github.com/ros2/ros2\_documentation/pull/2156](https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation/pull/2156). Let us know if that works for you.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 12/15/2021 10:08:24
How did you get the ros2\_control dependency? I saw that they recently renamed `spawner.py` to `spawner` and it may be affecting you (especially if you use the newest version of ros2\_control). Could you please make an issue about it?


In general, we test the webots\_ros2 package on Windows, but ros2\_control guys have been breaking the API lately. Hopefully, they will stabilize the API in Humble.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/15/2021 13:29:27
See [https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Simulators/Webots/Setting-up-a-Robot-Simulation-Webots.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Simulators/Webots/Setting-up-a-Robot-Simulation-Webots.html) (should work the same on foxy and galactic).

##### Robokashi 12/15/2021 13:31:40
Thank you for your answers ! I'll check this out today, I will come back with the results 🙂 !


I tried by stupidly following the instructions here : [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Build-and-Install](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Build-and-Install), this one gave me the error with the spanwer.py.

And I tried using the latest version of ros2\_control from their Github directly, I remember it did not work but I don't remember what was wrong exactly x) But I read an issue about the spawner,py being renamed spawner and I checked the sources and I think they fixed it, as I had the extension everywhere.

##### Darko Lukić [Moderator] 12/15/2021 13:39:19
`@Robokashi` Could you please create an issue with the error log you are getting:

##### Max\_K 12/15/2021 14:42:53
Sry for late reply and thanks for the answer. When i just start webots via cli and loading this specific .wbt and then export HTML5 model its printing in cli 
```Warning: QFile::copy: Empty or null file name (ca. 20x)
/usr/local/bin/webots: line 90: 33359 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) "$webots\_home/bin/webots-bin" "$@"
```

what i can read from coredumpctl gdb is this if it helps:

```Reading symbols from /usr/local/webots/bin/webots-bin...
(No debugging symbols found in /usr/local/webots/bin/webots-bin)
BFD: warning: /var/tmp/coredump-8Ry2rB is truncated: expected core file size >= 2670641152, found: 2147483648

and 

```Core was generated by `/usr/local/webots/bin/webots-bin'.

I tested the export with a sample .wbt like the spot world and it works fine. So i guess my world is the problem ..



I would like to host the simulation on a website. Visitors should then be able to interact with the robot e.g. Teleop. In principle like here: [https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/#](https://opensourcerover.jpl.nasa.gov/#)!/home

##### Amaral 12/16/2021 02:21:21
I see


The thing is, the robot is a wall follower, but the distance sensor limit is 10cm. So whenever it tries to do this turnes it starts hopping into the wall

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 12/16/2021 06:09:37
Can you change the sensor limit?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/16/2021 06:11:28
Can you show a quick video of the problem? A simple wall follower should be able to solve the maze

##### Amaral 12/16/2021 12:45:34
I can't, the maximum range is 10cm and im not allowed to use a different type of sensor

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/16/2021 19:20:06
You can probably solve this by simply limiting the turning speed or implementing a pd Controller. Perhaps you can post a Screenshot with distance se sor rays enabled in optional rendering (in the menu somewhere)

##### Amaral 12/16/2021 19:53:27
I tried limiting the speed and it got worse :(

What is a pd Controller ?

%end

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/16/2021 19:56:12
Looking at this, the best solution would probably be to build in some logic, when the sensor loses the wall, you know the position of the corner and drive straight until about where wheels   reach the corner and then start turning


For the 180 degree turn you might have to add some logic that it drives forward a bit after turning 90 and not detecting a wall, before turning again

##### Amaral 12/16/2021 19:58:22
Yea, I tried that too, the thing is the starting point of the robot on the maze isnt near any wall, so in the start all the sensors can't see any wall



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/921129218602061904/unknown.png)
%end


So the first thing it tries to do is find the left wall, if I add a logic like this it will conflict the current one

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/16/2021 20:00:30
You can have an approach of different operating modes like start, wall\_follow, turn etc.

##### Amaral 12/16/2021 20:00:57

Like rotines that are executed separately

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/16/2021 20:01:19

I have sensors currently but they are not catching the reading of the wall before its to late

##### Amaral 12/16/2021 21:13:35
Each sensor have a maximum range, the ultrasonic for example is 10cm. So if the one you are currently using inst going far enough try changing it

##### DrakerDG [Moderator] 12/16/2021 21:22:11
Don't forget that the ultrasonic have a blind point, aproxly at 45 grades to up

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:20:08
Hi everyone, I am simulating a 6 dof manipulator in WeBots and I want to run the rotational motors simultaneously not one after each other, which is currently happening. I read online that I should have the supervisor ticked to TRUE and then set the positions of the motors, then step the robot. However, this did not work as for some reason my robot steps automatically as soon as I start the simulation. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:22:18
In your controller you should have a loop that calls the step function. Just set all the motor positions in the robot controller (not supervisor) then execute the step


you could post your code if you want

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:24:50
```
while robot.step(time_step) != -1:
    final_joint_config = final_joint_configuration([0.065,0.2,0.5],0,10,0)

    path = path_joint_positions(final_joint_config)
    
    q = joint_velocities(path,[1,1,1,1,1,1])
    count = 0
    for motor in joints:
        temp_motor = robot.getDevice(motor)
        temp_motor.setPosition(final_joint_config[count + 1])
        temp_motor.setVelocity(q[count])
        count = count + 1
```


i have this

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:25:53
you should initialize all your devices BEFORE you run the loop


[https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots\_pyikfast\_tutorial](https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots_pyikfast_tutorial)


this is a inverse kinematics sample project i created, you might want to check it out

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:27:37
yeh thanks i will check it out


```
for motor in joints:
        temp_motor = robot.getDevice(motor)
        temp_motor.setVelocity(0.1)


while robot.step(time_step) != -1:
    final_joint_config = final_joint_configuration([0.065,0.2,0.5],0,10,0)

    path = path_joint_positions(final_joint_config)
    
    count = 0
    for motor in joints:
        temp_motor = robot.getDevice(motor)
        temp_motor.setPosition(final_joint_config[count + 1])
        count = count + 1
```


I have tried this and it still doesnt seem to work


i have noticed my linear motors work simultaneously but not my rotational motors

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:29:30
you gotta initialize your devices first


I have no idea what your `final_joint_configuration` does


and what the path is needed for

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:34:01
it uses an inverse kinematics library and returns the joint config

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:34:34
`motors = []

for motor in joints:

    motors.append(robot.getDevice(motor))

    motors[-1].setVelocity(0.1)





while robot.step(time\_step) != -1:

    final\_joint\_config = final\_joint\_configuration([0.065,0.2,0.5],0,10,0)



    path = path\_joint\_positions(final\_joint\_config)

    

    count = 0

    for motor in motors:

        motor.setPosition(final\_joint\_config[count + 1])

        count = count + 1`


try this


no idea how and if your IK works, but the rest should

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:35:45
i tried your code


the linear motors work simultaenously but not the rotational motors


which wait for the linear motors to reach the position


then start running

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:36:37
maybe post your whole project, hard to say from this snippet, but DONT initilize devices inside your main loop


`    for i, motor in enumerate(motors):

        motor.setPosition(final\_joint\_config[i + 1])`



this also seems much cleaner, although I dont understand the +1 part, why dont you start with the first join position?

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:39:08
i am using a urdf file with the inverse kinematics


and the first joint is the base link


which is fixed

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:39:27
What robot are you using?

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:39:54
my own robot

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:40:23
I highly recommend you use pyikfast. 100x better than ikpy, which you are probably using

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:40:44
yeh i am using ikpy

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:40:48
[https://github.com/cyberbotics/pyikfast](https://github.com/cyberbotics/pyikfast)

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:41:01
does pyikfast work with urdf file

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:41:04
if you want good performance and behavior, use this.


you have to compile a solver, that will take a bit of work, but is explained here

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:41:32
```
robot = Robot()
time_step = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

# initialising 


motors = []
for motor in joints:
    motors.append(robot.getDevice(motor))
    motors[-1].setVelocity(0.1)


while robot.step(time_step) != -1:
    final_joint_config = [ 0.0,0.4,-0.08 ,0,-1.45 ,0, -1.15,0]

    count = 0
    for motor in motors:
        motor.setPosition(final_joint_config[count + 1])
        count = count + 1
    
```

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:42:04
once you have the solver, you can use my code to control the robot. Trust me, I worked month on it and it is by far the best solution for 6 DOF robots while using python

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:42:37
do you think that is why my linear motors are running and finishing before my rotational motors start


i thought that was something wrong in my webots code/environment

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:42:52
I dont see your linear motors in the code

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:43:14
the first two motors in joints are linear


and the other 4 are rotational

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:43:55
ohhhh you have linear motors in the same robot... nvm, im not sure pyikfast works with that, you would have to read up on that


well it is hard to say, you should trouble shoot them. You do set the velocity to 0.1


that is 0.1 m/s for the linear, and only 0.1 RAD/s, meaning it takes a good 60 seconds for one full rotation


2 * pi is one full rotation


that is probably your main issue

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:46:38
```
robot = Robot()
time_step = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

# initialising 


motors = []
for motor in joints:
    motors.append(robot.getDevice(motor))
    if motor == "slider_1" or motor == "slider_2":
       motors[-1].setVelocity(0.1)
       print("slider")
    else:
       motors[-1].setVelocity(2*3.14)


while robot.step(time_step) != -1:
    final_joint_config = [ 0.0,0.4,-0.08 ,0,-1.45 ,0, -1.15,0]

    count = 0
    for motor in motors:
        motor.setPosition(final_joint_config[count + 1])
        count = count + 1
```


i tried this


but the rotational motors only start after the linear ones finish

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 05:48:17
I would leave out those velocity settings. That is something that should be defined in your robot model


Motors also have limited torque, maybe they are not strong enough. There are many reasons

##### Anshul 12/20/2021 05:51:04
i changed the torque and it seemed to have helped


thanks for the help

##### GeoCSBI 12/20/2021 10:11:01
Hey everyone! I have updated Webots to 2021b and for some reason, for the same project that was working with 2020 version, the getImage()/getImageArray() function of a camera object returns None. In the Webots environment the frame seems to change but for some reason I get None. Does anyone has any idea what is going on? 



P.S. I get the camera object using the getDevice() function.

P.S.2. The recognition module of the camera seems to work just fine, returning the detected object and its parameters along with its position to the image 



Thanks in advance!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/20/2021 10:22:10
I believe there was an issue with that, try installing the latest nightly version of 2021b

##### GeoCSBI 12/20/2021 10:24:09
I'll give it a try, thank you!

##### L4RG 12/20/2021 13:40:59
Good afternoon everyone! The Webots documentation mentions that basicTimeStep is the simulation timestep in milliseconds ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/glossary](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/glossary)). Is it possible to go even lower than this, e.g. calculating/evaluating the physics in microseconds? Or do I need to make some changes in my simulation setup to acquire similar precision (scaling other units)?



Update:

I just noticed that the 2019a version of the documentation mentions that microsecond precision is indeed possible ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo?version=R2019a](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo?version=R2019a)). Can anyone explain why the documentation has been changed, am I missing something? I have also set basicTimeStep = 0.001 in my simulation and it still runs & calculates.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/20/2021 19:45:55
While I am no expert, I doubt that it is, as it doesn't run Java code or servers. If you were to develop a web platform with Java utilizing webots, then you would have to make sure it is secure yourself though.

##### \_Q 12/20/2021 19:47:17
Thank you Simon.

##### ianchen0316 12/21/2021 03:28:58
Hello everyone! I encounter some issues when using --stream option to stream the simulation renderings to a webpage. 



In server side, when Webots is opened with GUI (1.png), and streaming is set via the following command: 

           webots --mode=realtime --minimize --batch --stream='mode=mjpeg;port=1234'  example.wbt 

Everything works fine. I can connect to the URL of the streaming server, and see the renderings of current simulation (2.png)



Since I want Webots to also run in headless mode, I set up an xvfb Xserver and set the DISPLAY environment variable:

          export DISPLAY=:99

          Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 & 

          webots --mode=realtime --minimize --batch --stream='mode=mjpeg;port=1234'  example.wbt 

However, this time, when connecting to the URL of the streaming server, I see the connection is successful, but nothing is rendered in the streaming page (3.png).  



Also, the above approach works fine when running on a server with no screen output. The problem only occurs when Webots run on server with screen.  

Does anyone know what may cause this problem? 



Many thanks in advance!

##### L4RG 12/21/2021 15:30:46
The simulation runs with basicTimeStep < 0.5 (no warnings either).  Then, I try to use the same timestep in my control loop (while wb\_robot\_step(TIME\_STEP) ~= -1 where TIME\_STEP = 0.5). However, printing the time instances when reading a sensor (with wb\_robot\_get\_time()) still shows time increments of 1ms. What is going on?

##### Max\_K 12/21/2021 17:38:50
Hi, I would like to simulate the spot in webots and use it with ROS2 for navigation2 etc.. I saw the discussion and wonder if there is any new information since then.

Other than that, I also read this blog article from SoftServe who have "successfully deployed the Spot under AWS Robomaker."

Would it be a promising option to port this repo/spot kinematic with ROS connectivity to webots? 

SoftServe Spot Repo: [https://github.com/SoftServeSAG/robotics\_spot/tree/temp\_robomaker](https://github.com/SoftServeSAG/robotics_spot/tree/temp_robomaker)

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 12/22/2021 01:00:48
looking at the documentation, it looks like the step function might be the culprit, as it accepts int [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb\_robot\_step](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=c++#wb_robot_step)

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/22/2021 07:36:56
Sure, normally you have all what you need with Webots: a model of the Spot robot and a ROS 2 interface. It's a matter of putting them together which should be fairly easy to achieve. Let us know if you have questions on how to proceed.

Is there documentation on how to build Webots from source (MacOS).  I think I have all the build tools already installed because I built it a couple years ago.

##### nap 12/22/2021 08:09:02
There is a lot of information that links from that page, but no build instructions.


`make release` from the repo's home directory produces the following output:

```

There is, [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/macOS-installation/](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/macOS-installation/)

##### nap 12/22/2021 09:00:18
Thanks, I'm working through that page setting up my Development environment.  If I have further questions about it, I will ask later.


But I do have a small question about `git submodules`.  I've checked-out the `R2021b` tag, and I'm wondering what git command I would use to synchronise the submodules with that particular version.  Should I use `git submodule sync`?


I suspect `git submodule update` is actually the correct command to use.


Is this a good place to discuss build issues?

Several issues (with `R2021b` checked out):

1) ./lib/controller/ folder in the REPO does not have the following folders, which all contain `vehicle.py`; python27, python37, python38, python39.

**Fixed** by copying these folders from my Installed Webots.

2) My Mac (Catalina 10.15.6) only has `2.7` in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions`.  I have python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 installed via homebrew, but they are in `/usr/local/opt/python@...`.  As a result, I'm getting messages during the build saying "skipping Python API" for each of these.

**EDIT** Fixed by making a symlink in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions` for each version as follows: `sudo ln -sf /usr/local/opt/python@3.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/ 3.7` (Not sure this is the best way of going about it, but it works.)



3) I'm getting several messages about `dylib`having been built for MacOS 10.15 but being linked to 10.13.  I assume this has something to do with the minimum deployment target.



4) With #1 fixed, I'm now getting an error, well into the build, for `make python python3.9` stating `vehicle39.cpp:178:11: fatal error: 'Python.h' file not found`.  This file is located in `/usr/local/opt/python@3.9/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/include/python3.9/Python.h`

**EDIT** fixed via the symlinks generated for #2 above.


With the above issues resolved, I'm now getting **404** errors downloading various things from `[https://www.cyberbotics.com](https://www.cyberbotics.com)`:

5) I haven't seen these kinds of operations during builds, so I'm not entirely sure what is going on:

`@Olivier Michel` Hi, sorry to tag you directly. On 05/08/2019, you stated that it is impossible to have a timestep smaller than 1ms (or control updates higher than 1kHz). 



Is this still the case for Webots?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/22/2021 15:10:29
it's technically possible, but in practice I don't think it works as intended. There's an open issue about it

##### L4RG 12/22/2021 18:26:44
do you have a link to the issue?

edit: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1669](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1669)



Indeed seems that this has not been fixed and/or is a design choice.

Is there a make flag that can be used to echo all issued commands?


`wget [https://cyberbotics.com/files/repository/dependencies/mac/release/develop/libssh.tar.bz2](https://cyberbotics.com/files/repository/dependencies/mac/release/develop/libssh.tar.bz2) -P /Users/user/Programming/webots/webots/dependencies` **fails.**



In the above make invocation, I used `-j4`.  I've now, at least until I get a successful build, am using `-j1`.  So this 404 error could be the 1st of several, as suggested in the build output above.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/23/2021 07:38:46
This could be a problem of the build system (Makefile) which doesn't support well multi-processing (`-j` option).

##### nap 12/23/2021 07:40:49
I'm now using `-j1`, so I'm avoiding the parallel build problem.

Fairly certain but I'll confirm it once and brb


Actually, it did not crash when I tried running the loop through a single iteration by changing the condition. I'll look into it further to confirm if my original loop was in fact, infinite

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/23/2021 08:23:29
If you have no plan to use java controllers, you can skip the compilation of java stuff by modifying the Makefiles.


Or upgrade to a more recent version of javac.

##### nap 12/23/2021 09:01:22

Thanks Olivier!

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/23/2021 09:53:25
Hi, after analysing my code quite a bit, I don't think the loop I'd nested was infinite.

I also tried changing the structure of the code quite a bit and the simulation window still always stops at exactly 16ms.

Further, if the loop were infinite, I don't think the simulation should freeze, right?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/23/2021 09:57:17
the simulation only advances if the the outer while loop is executed (specifically, if the step function is called). If inside it you loop infinitely, it doesn't advance and most likely webots becomes irresponsive (if you see the CPU run at nearly 100%) during that "freeze", then you're likely looping. But you can post the file of the controller, so we can take  a look

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/23/2021 10:02:26
I think this is the issue, the nested loop was supposed to assign motor velocities based on sensor readings at each point, until a destination is reached. The outer while loop was supposed to change only the destination itself. 

So, if I call the step function in my nested loop, will it work?


It worked!

Thank you so much : )

##### nap 12/25/2021 09:01:19
Out of curiosity, what IDE is used/recommended for working with `Webots` source code itself on MacOS?  If it's Xcode, is there a Xcode Project somewhere?


Another question; after building Webots, are **all** files situation locally or are there still portions that need to be accessed via the internet?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 12/25/2021 09:53:57
After building from the sources, all the files should be there, so that nothing should be downloaded while using Webots.

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/25/2021 14:16:48

(Q1) Is LUA/Javascript used for anything else other than procedural PROTO definitions?  (Q2) Does the UI provide subscribable events and/or an API to manupulate the UI?  (Not referring to the supervisor functionality here.)


After ONE successful build, I'm now getting the following error.

I haven't done anything here, but it seems that things back on the GitHub server are changing and they are affecting my local build.  I don't think this should be happening, unless I `pull` or something.

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/26/2021 09:36:23
Hi all, can we connect Webots with sumo which is outside of the Webots directory?

##### nap 12/26/2021 10:18:46
Though I haven't used `sumo` before, have you tried the sample project @ `./projects/vehicles/worlds/sumo_interface_example.wbt` ?


I think it's expecting an `external` controller as I'm getting networking messages stating `connection refused`.  (That's because I'm not running sumo itself.)


Why is it that, after compiling from source, when I load a sample project (e.g. ./gctronic/e-puck/worlds/e-puck\_kinematic.wbt), Webots says its `Downloading Assets` and it downloads what it needs from  `githubusercontent.com`?

(a) Shouldn't I already have all files/assets used by Webots given I've cloned the repository and built `distrib` from source, and

(b) What happens when I don't have internet access?

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/26/2021 19:46:09
Thank you for your explanation. Yeah, that's the case. I wanna run SUMO externally. Is there any possibility to edit the directory to SUMO?

##### nap 12/27/2021 03:13:09
Look in the Webots documentation for an explanation of what an ‘external’ controller is.


Here are some links to relevant documentation:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide)

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-plugin](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-plugin)

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming)

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)


Late in the build process, `updating proto cache`, Webots is executed with the `--update-proto-cache` flag.

Is there documentation that explains exactly what this does?  It appears as though Webots is invoked `headless`.

I know it at least compiles some controllers (e-puck in my case), but what else?


Another question:  When Webots is started, it loads the last world that was open.  Where is this information stored?  And, as a follow-up, where in the code is this location determined?

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/27/2021 07:20:24
Hi, if anyone could help me out with this, I'd really appreciate it. I'd like to import an assembly but SolidWorks can save it only as stl, among the available options and in that case everything is imported as a single part. Further, the coordinate systems for each part end up in unpredictable locations.



Thank you once again! : )

##### Yannnick3 [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 08:00:34
As stated in the documentation ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu)), only VRML97 is supported in Webots. Also Webots doesn't implement all the fields of VRML, but your shape should still be functional.


This error message may come from a problem in the Sumo compilation. You can try to re-compile Sumo directly in `webots/projects/default/resources` with `make clean` and `make release`.

##### nap 12/27/2021 09:54:47
I'm going to express an opinion that may not be popular, but I I really don't like this business of downloading things from the internet all the time simply to save on the size of the installation file.  I never had any issues downloading the 1.5GB install, but I'm now frustrated that each time I clean then build (as per Yannick suggestion above), I have to download stuff in order to build.  And to make matters worse, after the build completes, it deletes what was downloaded.


Unfortunately, it's not working, returning the same error as before.

Something was downloaded when I ran the world into:

```
Temporary network files generated in /var/folders/tg/vymk3ysd1n14cpx7r7_q5pgw0000gn/T/tmpzpntda44
Loading configuration ... done.
Parsing nodes from '/var/folders/tg/vymk3ysd1n14cpx7r7_q5pgw0000gn/T/tmpzpntda44/sumo.nod.xml' ... done.
Parsing edges from '/var/folders/tg/vymk3ysd1n14cpx7r7_q5pgw0000gn/T/tmpzpntda44/sumo.edg.xml' ... done.
Parsing connections from '/var/folders/tg/vymk3ysd1n14cpx7r7_q5pgw0000gn/T/tmpzpntda44/sumo.con.xml' ... done.
```

But all I'm seeing is an intersection with four traffic lights of two roads that lead to infinite horizons.



**EDIT**  I looked into that folder and here is a list of what's there:

generate\_route\_file.py

plugin.py

sumo.con.xml

sumo.det.xml

sumo.edg.xml

sumo.net.xml

sumo.netccfg

sumo.nod.xml

sumo.rou.xml

sumo.sumocfg



I must have tried running this example 6 times because there are 6 folders with these files.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 10:10:24
If you use the Webots development environment, all files are available locally. If you use a pre-built binary, the files are downloaded and cached progressively as needed (by opening worlds that require them) and are removed only if you expressly clear the cache from the preferences. When the "downloading assets" shows up, doesn't mean it downloads it everytime. If it finds the asset in the cache, it will use it.


Sumo examples should work out of the box, just by pressing play. If it doesn't, it might be a bug.


except for ubuntu 18 if I remember right, that does require compiling sumo manually

##### nap 12/27/2021 10:16:27
I think you are incorrect.

I just did what Yannick suggested, clean and build.

First, the clean deleted everything but the make file.  Then a tar.gz was downloaded and extracted.  Then the compilation too place, and when it finished, the tar.gz was deleted.  (So if I clean/build again, these same process occurs; i.e. there is a download each time.)

I have the same issue when I open worlds using the `webots` binary that is included in the root folder of the repo.  When I run `./projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/worlds/e-puck_kinematic.wbt`.  I get the `Downloading Assets` dialog with the progress bar, and afterwards the simulation runs.


I'm running MacOS Catalina 10.15.6


that may be the intention, but that's not how its working on MacOS.


If you look into the Makefile that is in `./projects/default/resources` you will see there is a `wget` in the last line of each `ifeq` for each OS Type.

To be more precise, line 69 of the Makefile performs the `wget` and line 79 performs the delete.


I am using the `R2022a` tag here.


With respect to the `Sumo` demo, each time I reset using the UI button that looks like `|<<`, and the run, I get a new temp folder with those files in it.

But the simulation does not run, and fails with the `connection refused` error.

Do I need to run `Sumo` from the command line in a separate terminal?

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 11:21:54
By assets I mean textures and sounds, those are included locally in the development environment and aren't removed on a `make clean`. On a pre-built binary, even if the progress bar appears it might just be checking the cache. You can verify this by putting airplane mode or disconnecting internet and reloading the world. Even without connection, it should still have all the textures (assuming you have opened this world at least once before  (or another world that uses the same assets)). 

If by "tar.gz" you are talking about sumo specifically, then yes, that should be re-downloaded on a `make cleanse`, not a `make clean`, so it might be unintended yes.

As for SUMO, you don't need to. When you press play the sumo interface should pop up. On macOs you might need to install XQuartz: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/sumo-interface#how-to-include-the-interface](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/sumo-interface#how-to-include-the-interface)

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/27/2021 11:51:24
Thank you for responding : )

I actually meant VRML97 not 95. I've imported files of the format before but after the update I've been unable to. Sorry about the confusion.

##### nap 12/27/2021 12:14:35
I already have XQuartz 2.7.11, which according to the documentation is sufficient, and it is reachable in my PATH variable.

After reading the documentation link you posted, I added a path to the SUMO folder to my PATH variable.

However, even after this, no UI pops up for me, just the messages in the Webots Console saying:

*Import done: 9 nodes / 16 edges ....*, *Summary: Node type statistics....Writing network ... Success*,  then:

Connect to SUMO...  `Unable to connect to SUMO, please make sure any previous instance of SUMO is closed.  You can try changing SUMO port using the "--port" argument.`

 Retrying.  `Could not connect to TraCI server at localhost:8873 [Errno 61] Connection refused` x 20 (approx)

`WARNING: 'sumo_supervisor' controller exited with status: 1.`

##### Yannnick3 [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 14:33:58
I see. What do you mean by "it is impossible to import VRML97 parts"? Do you get an error message or is it just displayed in a weird way? For the latter could you please provide screenshots?


What I would suggest to you is to build Webots from source as I understand it isn't what you do rn and try the SUMO example worlds. Opening them and directly pressing the RUN button should be working straight away. If not, I believe this may be a problem linked to your configuration.

##### nap 12/27/2021 14:44:07
I have built Webots 2022a from source.

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/27/2021 14:45:04
Basically, the files I'd saved as VRML97 to use in the 2021 version are no longer visible at all, when I try to import them. I'll send the screenshots in a bit, I've already reverted back to the 2021 version so I'll need to download the new version again.

Thank you for your help!

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 14:45:49
That feature has been removed from 2022 as far as I know, let me double check

##### nap 12/27/2021 14:46:10
TBH, I'm not that worried about this as I'm not actually using SUMO.  I just was trying to help the other person.

I asked several other questions though.

##### Yannnick3 [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 14:46:31
Have you tried to follow this procedure to compile SUMO: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/SUMO-compilation#mac](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/SUMO-compilation#mac) ?

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/27/2021 14:49:04
Ohh, I see, if this is the case, please let me know. Also, in that case, what would be the best method of importing an entire assembly as individual parts? Also, is it possible to change the coordinate axes corresponding to each part? I can't seem to figure out how the axis for the parts I'm importing as .stl is chosen, making the selection of the center of mass difficult

##### nap 12/27/2021 14:50:12
No, I haven't tried recompiling SUMO.  I've been relying on what was already provided by building `distrib`.

But, as I said, I'm not really concerned about this as I'm not using it for my work.  I was simply trying to help Ranga Kulathunga.



There are other questions I asked above, to which an answer would help me get my head around what I'm trying to do here.

##### Ranga Kulathunga 12/27/2021 15:52:34

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/27/2021 19:05:19
It's just a shortcut, it means the physics node is defined elsewhere and there the same node is just being re-used. Somewhere in the world file you'll find a "DEF TIP\_PHYSICS", that's where it is defined

##### SeanLuTW 12/28/2021 07:34:11
Hi, I have a self-wrote `.wbt` file with unknown wrong format, when I opened it with Webots, it directly jumped to default `unnamed.wbt` with no additional information. Is there any tool to check where the format of my `.wbt` went wrong?


On the other hand, can I set the default world file from `unnamed.wbt` to other world file?


I found that if I open the world with command line and redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to my console, I can see where it went wrong.

##### Expert\_Amateur 12/29/2021 11:02:19

So, I need your help to get the position of KukaBox and youBot grippers' position. Because I want to minimize the distance between them. I hope, I could explain it enough. Any help of you would make me more than happy.

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/31/2021 17:18:56
Indeed it was removed. I assume it's a robot you want to import which means there will be moving parts (wheels, arms, ...) so you will need at the very least to export these components individually (i.e as separate pieces), in STL or Obj format for example. Then on Webots, you can re-build your robot using the classic approach of adding nodes and joints for the moving parts ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)). What differs is that the geometries that comprise your robot are expressed in external files, which you can include by using the `Mesh` node (which you can add in the `geometry` field of a `Shape` node). If these parts are not centred, you can remove or change the offsets using other tools like Blender (you should be able to find how to on google/youtube).


You can use a supervisor to retrieve the position of any `Solid` node ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)).

Out of curiosity, what might be the reason it was removed? It seemed like a pretty convenient feature

##### DDaniel [Cyberbotics] 12/31/2021 17:54:02
The YouBot is defined as a PROTO (`projects/robots/kuka/youbot/protos`), so you will need to modify it by adding a `DEF GRIPPER` to the Solid node at line L150. Since this node is internal to the proto, you will need to use the `get_from_proto_def` function to retrieve a reference to it


Not sure, but I think it's because it's a very old standard, as the 97 in the name suggests and increasingly less software supports exporting it (other than through addons and what not)

##### drl\_bot 12/31/2021 18:06:29
