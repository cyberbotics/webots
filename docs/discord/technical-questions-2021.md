# Technical-Questions 2021

This is an archive of the `technical-questions` channel of the [Webots Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/nTWbN9m) for year 2021.

## January

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 00:01:23
I tried 3.9 and 3.7, same result both times.

##### KajalGada 01/01/2021 00:39:04
`@RoboCoder` I assume you are using Windows. What did you set your Python command in Webots preferences?

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 01:32:28
I tried a few things, but right now its set to "python"

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/01/2021 11:08:41
`@RoboCoder` What PATH variables did you set exactly? You should add something like this:

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38

C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts


Unless you are on Linux or Mac, then it looks differently.

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 16:51:01
Should both of those be set in one PATH variable, or in two separate ones?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/01/2021 17:08:12
just add them beneath each other. Same variable

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 18:03:14
Okay. Does the variable name matter?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/01/2021 18:03:34
you are on windows right?


You have to change the "Path" variable [https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html](https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html)

##### RoboCoder 01/01/2021 18:08:16
Yep, on windows. I'll try that and get back to you.


Just wondering, does the version matter? I'm on 3.7 right now.


Okay, it's working now! I restarted the computer and it solved my issue. Thank you!

##### Yang 01/02/2021 11:50:31
Hi folks, I'm new to webots, just tried out a few examples on my PC, feels great! I'm wondering whether webots accepts urdf format files and mesh files (.stl etc.)?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/02/2021 12:37:40
`@Yang` you can directly import 3d meshes through the webots menu. In order to convert URDF to webot's PROTO format, use this:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)


I made a more detailed tutorial on how to do that:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)

##### Yang 01/02/2021 12:54:10
thank you Simon, I will check that out!

##### Nicolas Y 01/03/2021 14:30:49
Hi guys I'm also very new to Webots and I'm working on creating the 'Yamor Snake' but I can't figure out how to use 'Connectors' to get the pieces to stick together does anyone know how to get it done?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/03/2021 16:23:54
`@Nicolas Y` the hierarchy should look something like this:

Robot > children  > Hingejoint > endPoint Solid > children > Hingejoint > endPoint Solid > children > Hingejoint  ...etc

##### pnaraltnsk 01/03/2021 16:25:38
Hi, I am using webots for my graduation project and I am working on the Nao robot. I am trying to add pen node to my robot to mark the robot's walking path but for some reason, the pen node doesn't write. I added pen node to my robot's leftFootSlot and exactly like in pen.wbt example. Could you please help me out with this situation? Or do you know any other ways to mark the robot's walking path?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/03/2021 16:29:13
`@pnaraltnsk` Hi, make sure to follow the documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pen?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pen?tab-language=python)

Make sure you activated the pen and that the parameters work for you. Also keep this in mind:

In order to be paintable, an object should be made up of a Solid node containing a Shape with a valid Geometry and an ImageTexture. The painted layer is applied over the texture without modifying it.

##### Nicolas Y 01/03/2021 16:30:16
`@Simon Steinmann` Thanks! I'll try it now 🙂

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 05:21:22
hi guys, I am new in webots

I build this arena, my question is how to detect robot outside the arena? the idea is I want to make auto-referee for this arena, so which one outside first will be lose

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 06:59:01
A solid could have multiple contact point, so the `index` specifies which contact point info you want. The `index` should be included between 0 and the result of `getNumberOfContactPoints()`:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_contact_point)

Yes, the contact point can be returned only for a `Solid` (or `Robot`) node that doesn't have a direct parent `Solid` node, otherwise you will get NaN values as explained in the documentation.


The `time0to100` value is used to generate the object and compute the maximum acceleration value. So, yes, you can assume that the maximum acceleration is set only in the initialization. Given that the car is a procedural PROTO node, even if you should change the `time0to100` value, the whole robot node would be recreated and the controller will be restarted.


Hi, for your problem the best option would probably be to add a Supervisor node in your world and write a supervisor controller that monitors the status and the positions of the robots. Given that you know the size of the arena, you can get the robot position and check if it is outside:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 07:33:10
sorry to reply my own question, while waiting the answer from the other, I do some test and the answer is **Supervisor**

just add robot node and enable Supervisor in properties and make some program to get the position of the robot

thanks for reply, just test and its very easy to get robot position, many thanks for your reply

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 07:37:07
You're welcome!

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 07:38:02
the next is, how to make robot falling if outside from the arena

any idea how to build proper arena for sumo competition?

%end

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 07:40:02
Does your robot have Physics enabled? If yes, and if the floor `boundingObject` of  your arena corresponds to the graphical round area, then robot should automatically fall once outside.

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 07:40:24
wait, check it first


this robot is e-puck, so default physics is enable, I think the problem is how I build the arena because its square floor with plane bounding, so I need to change bounding yes?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 07:44:05
Yes, a plane in `boundingObject` has infinite size. You could use a Cylinder or a Box instead

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 07:44:32
ok thanks, will try it and will give report here


wow great, thanks

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 08:24:47
`@PowerYdRa`  A very simple way to check for "falling off" is to check the height of the robots. If the robot is below the arena surface, it loses. That's like 3 lines of code 🙂

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 08:58:07
yes, thats the idea, but how to show some notification in the arena (not in console) ? any suggestion?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:07:55
`from controller import Supervisor



\# disqualify height

y\_min = 0



supervisor = Supervisor()

timestep = int(supervisor.getBasicTimeStep())

robot\_1 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_1')

robot\_2 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_2')



root = supervisor.getRoot()

rootChildren = root.getField('children')

nNodes = rootChildren.getCount()

robotList = []

for i in range(nNodes):

    node = rootChildren.getMFNode(i)

    if node.getBaseTypeName() == 'Robot' and node.getDef() != 'referee':

        robotList.append(node)

nRobots = len(robotList)    

isActive = [1] *  nRobots

print(str(nRobots) + " Robots found")





while supervisor.step(timestep) != -1:

    for i in range(nRobots):

        pos = robotList[i].getPosition()

        if pos[1] < y\_min:

            isActive[i] = 0

        if sum(isActive) <= 1:

            print('Fight over!')

            `


`@PowerYdRa` this is a little example of a more general approach of the referee. This way it does not matter how many robots you add and what their DEF is. The only thing that matters is, that the supervisor Robot has the DEF "referee"

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 09:08:52
wow nice, thanks for the code, will try it

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:09:11
let me know if you have questions

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 09:09:24
okay, thanks for your help

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:09:29
robot\_1 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_1')

robot\_2 = supervisor.getFromDef('Robot\_2')



wups, these two lines are not needed

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 09:12:27
You may use supervisor labels to display notifications in the 3D view: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_set\_label](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_set_label)

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:13:06
ahhh that's what I was looking for :p

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 09:13:20
Or a Display device (which may be a child of your supervisor Robot): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display)

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 09:14:55
noted, thanks for your reply

will try it after fix the arena view, its look weird only show white 😆

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:38:20
`@PowerYdRa` added the display

even changes the color from green to red, when a robot is out 😄

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 09:47:58
Hi I have a question. I want to rotate the coordinates of the anchor. How can you do it?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:48:26
What do you mean by anchor?


you mean in a hingejoint?

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 09:49:34
I want to rotate the anchor in the joint parameters of the hinge joint.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:50:02
it is relative to the parent


so you need to change the parent orientation, or add a transform node inbetween

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 09:50:53
I want to add a joint at a specific location. But I can't hold the axis of rotation in the direction I want.


Where should I add the transform node?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 09:52:26
The easiest solution would be to position the hingejoint with a parent transform node.


Or you position the location with the anchor, and change the axis value. but this will be less intuitive, as the axis wont be along either the x, y or z axis any more

##### Master.L 01/04/2021 10:34:14
Thank you `@Simon Steinmann`. Thanks to that, the problem was solved.

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 10:53:21

@Stefania Pedrazzi#5404  understood , but for example a two finger gripper to grasp an object , so I will have multiple contact points, and I get them by specifying the index , then how can I identify through this index that which solids is in contact !?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 12:25:03
You cannot get information about the other solid which is in contact with the current node from the Supervisor API. If you need this advanced information, then you should implement a physics plugin and retrieve this information from the `webots_physics_collide` callback function:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin?tab-language=python)

However, if you just need to check if point belongs to the contact between the two finger, then there are maybe other simpler solutions, for example to compare the returned contact points of finger 1 and finger 2.

##### yash 01/04/2021 12:48:17
Alright understood , just one more thing , we have to specify a node to use the function  -

def getNumberofContactpoints() , how to do that?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 12:53:05
There are many different ways to retrieve a node, here is the link to the documentation:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def) (and all the other functions in this section)

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_node](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_field_get_mf_node)

You can find an example in the sample simulation:

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 13:45:59
can webots save the world with lock mode? I mean object in the world can't be replace, add or remove until we insert some password or passcode?

`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  thanks a lot !

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 13:50:34
this is because, I want to share the world to student, so they cant change everything except coding the robot only

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 14:02:48
`@PowerYdRa` Something like that is not possible from Webots. It should be handled by your OS. For example, you can set the world file permissions to read-only mode, so only the administrator can edit it.

##### PowerYdRa 01/04/2021 14:04:29
if I setup server like in this tutorial [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-simulation?tab-language=python)

can other people do some programming for robot?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 14:05:48
Yes, in that case it would be similar to:

[https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/)

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 14:15:39
`@PowerYdRa` you can have them export their robot as a .wbo file and give you their controller as well


you can then load them into your world

##### yash 01/04/2021 14:41:58
I have set  SUPERVISOR field to TRUE, so to use  .getDevice() functions for sensors and motors ,  will robot.getDevice() be applicable ?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:23:14
`@Simon Steinmann` Hi Simon, thanks for you're help earlier but I can't seem to figure out how to 'bound' them so that all eight 'Yamors' move as one bigger whole

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 15:32:42
Yes

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:32:52
You have to put a "Robot" node as your base node `@Nicolas Y`

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:33:01
I did

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:33:13
and add motors in the device section of the hingejoints


what exactly is your problem?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:35:06
I'm not sure how to get the components to stick

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:35:37
Post your world file here


one thing I can see from the screenshot is, that you have not added JointParameters


double click on them and add a Parameter node


The individual Solids also need a physics node and a bounding Geometry

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:40:17
This is my world file

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:41:45
ohhh


you added all the segments as children of the robot


you have to put each next joint into the children node of the Solid before

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:42:32
ohhh


I'll try that now

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:43:01
you can add boundingObject and physics by simply doubleclicking it


ohh wait, all the Yamor are individual robots?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:43:34
yes

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:43:55
are they supposed to be individually controlled?

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:44:09
no I want them to work as one

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:44:09
Because I'm not sure about a chain of robot nodes

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:44:37
oh?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:45:43
Perhaps the devs know the best solution for that. I'm not sure about Robots containing other Robots

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:47:03
oh


that complicates things

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:48:34
`@Olivier Michel` How does a hierarchy of robots work? Do the child robots act as devices if they don't have a controller assigned?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 15:49:23
No, a robot can access only the devices it contains. If a robot contains another robot, the devices of the child robot are not available to the parent robot.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/04/2021 15:50:36
`@Nicolas Y` I think you are supposed to add one Yamor, then doubleclick on 'extensionSlot' and add another

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:51:22
`@Olivier Michel` in which case how can one replicate this?
%figure

%end

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 15:57:41
In this example (included in Webots), each module is an independent robot (there is no hierarchy).


Robots attach to each other with a Connector node.

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 15:59:55
`@Olivier Michel` okay thanks I'll try that

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 16:17:39
I would recommend you to start from the yamor demo and modify it bit-by-bit to ensure you are not breaking anything.

##### Nicolas Y 01/04/2021 16:33:35
`@Olivier Michel` sorry but despite checking the website I can't seem to figure out how to use the 'Connector' node to Combine the two 'Yamor' nodes

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/04/2021 16:34:45
I would recommend you to open the world file in a text  editor.


Yes, in the scene tree of Webots, but it may be easier to edit from a text editor (but this is a question of personal preferences).

##### pnaraltnsk 01/04/2021 20:28:39
Hi, I followed the documentation and checked everything else. Everything looks fine and the pen should have been working but it didn't. I am still struggling to find what's wrong.

##### TerryWr1st 01/05/2021 00:19:20
Hi all, new to this channel. I'm developing my thesis in Webots, which consists of a number of epucks at the start of the simulation. During runtime, I then need to spawn additional epucks and delete the old epucks which have served their purpose in the simulation. Is this possible in Webots? And is it achieved through a supervisor function, or some other method?

##### DDaniel 01/05/2021 00:47:52
Yes you can do it using the supervisor, you can add and remove the nodes of the robots from the scene tree: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)

##### TerryWr1st 01/05/2021 00:50:29
Ah ok, brilliant, thank you. Will take a look.

##### pk1jk1 01/05/2021 03:35:29
Has anyone successfully implemented RRT for a robot to get to a waypoint?

##### Alessia Valle 01/05/2021 08:54:35
Hi, I'm working on my Master Thesis and I need your help if possible. I have imported my four-wheeled robot CAD model into webots and I need to interface it with ROS (not ROS2) to implement SLAM algorithm. The robot is equipped with a Lidar sensor. I have gone through webots and ROS documentation but I am still stuck.

I have seen that to use slam\_gmapping, my mobile robot needs to provide odometry data and I need to publish two different transforms, base\_laser->base\_link and base\_link->odom. Since I am novice to ROS and I have no experience in interfacing it with webots, here are my questions:

- how to make my robot publish its odometry? my idea is to use Position Sensors, but I don't know how to turn the values from the position sensors into the standard nav\_msgs/Odometry used in ROS. I think I am missing some steps. 

- since I need to publish transforms of odom, base\_link and base\_laser to use with gmapping, do I need to create the URDF of my robot? 

Thank you in advance

Excuse me, I have a question.

I am implementing a delta robot model in webots.

There is an upper leg that moves by a hinge joint and a lower leg that is connected to the upper leg by a ball joint.

Since the hinge joint is moved after starting the simulation, the ball joint continues to rotate and the position value increases. Therefore, the part connected to the ball joint continues to rotate. How can I fix it?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:15:59
`@Alessia Valle` a Position sensor measures the angle of a joint / motor. What you need is the Pose

[http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav\_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html)


this is the nav\_msgs definition

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/05/2021 09:16:39
Hello `@Alessia Valle`,

- For odometry, see the example here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/9682e06932929ea3bfab5a6a826f6fe67471aef6/webots\_ros2\_core/webots\_ros2\_core/webots\_differential\_drive\_node.py#L128-L197](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/9682e06932929ea3bfab5a6a826f6fe67471aef6/webots_ros2_core/webots_ros2_core/webots_differential_drive_node.py#L128-L197)

(it is for ROS2 but there is almost no difference for ROS)

- You don't have create URDF to publish transforms. If your model is simple you can publish them manually, see an example for a physical robot:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/epuck\_ros2/blob/master/epuck\_ros2\_driver/src/driver.cpp#L167-L232](https://github.com/cyberbotics/epuck_ros2/blob/master/epuck_ros2_driver/src/driver.cpp#L167-L232)

(If you need URDF you can use [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_urdf](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_urdf))

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:21:38
is the ball joint passive? If so. you have to add friction


so expand the balljoint and add a "JointParameters" node


there you can edit those values

what could be the issue ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:36:45
can you click on your robot and show a screenshot (with the white lines of the bounding box)


My first guess would be, that you used the visual mesh data as collision. And your shapes are not convex


Also it seems like it might be starting partially in the floor

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:39:27

how could I rectify the problem ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:40:13
oh the grey metal part is not part of the robot?


and it looks like therre is a horizontal part, which has no visual

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:40:55
no it is not the part of the robot

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:41:11
but the robot is attached to it?


In general it is much better (for performance AND accuracy) to replace the boundingObject with simple geometries, such as boxes, spheres, cylinders and capsules

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:42:08
yes I have positioned the robot accordingly, but it is not attached to it.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:45:33

##### yash 01/05/2021 09:47:12
the 2 link manipulator should rotate about it's axis provided. With the metal plate at it's position only.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:48:39
you have to make its axis static then


remove the physics node of the Robot


it still seems weird to me, that you have 3 segments in your bounding object


there is something weird there

Can Webots compile in x86, or only x64? I went through the visual studio setup both manually,  and with the wizard. The wizard sets the configuration properties as Release/x64, but this step isn't mentioned in the manual set up guide: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide)


Also, why does the wizard default to a Release configuration instead of debug?

##### Diego Rojas 01/06/2021 05:50:10
What would be the best way to simulate a ur5 robot on a 7th axis linear track using ROS2 and moveit2? I would like to control both the linear motion of the 7th axis track and the robot arm with moveit2. Using the follow\_joint\_trajectory action server, I was able to control the ur5 robot with ros2 control and moveit2, but now I want to attach the robot to a linear track. I have done this in the past in gazebo by creating a prismatic joint and using the follow\_joint\_trajectory controller to control it with ros\_control and moveit. Is this possible in webots also? How can I utilize the existing follow\_joint\_trajectory action server that is created in webots\_ros2 and create another follow\_joint\_trajectoy action server for a linear/prismatic joint with webots\_ros2?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 07:12:43
Webots can compile controllers in either x64 or x86. However, by default it will build x64 binaries. If you want to build a x86 controller binary, you should be sure to link it with `WEBOTS_HOME\msys64\mingw32\bin\Controller.dll` instead of `WEBOTS_HOME\msys64\mingw64\bin\Controller.dll`.

##### yash 01/06/2021 07:38:12
I am working on a certain application that involves grasping a human foot. I imported the human foot CAD using .VRML format. And used the DEF geometry indexfaceset in the shape node to define the bounding object of the human foot. But the bounding object seems to be complex which is resulting in weird physics behavior.  How to address this issue such that the human foot remains stable ?

Because when I replaced the foot with a simple cylindrical solid it worked fine since the bounding object of the cylinder is not complex.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 07:48:08
The used formula comes from standard steering dynamics. Depending if the front or rear  wheels drive the car (or all four wheels) you need to compute the ratio for the left and right wheel because the do not turn using the same angle.

Here is the reference to a chapter about steering dynamics: [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8544-5\_7](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8544-5_7) but you can probably find other references on the web.

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 07:53:37
You should create a compound bounding object for the foot that is not a mesh, but a combination of simple primitives (spheres, capsules, cylinders and boxes). See this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes) for an example of creating a compound bounding object.

##### yash 01/06/2021 08:01:33
alright ! but this wiil solve the issue right irrespective of the solid geometry ?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 08:02:22
It should (as long as you don't include any mesh in the bounding object).

##### yash 01/06/2021 08:02:48
understood, thanks a lot !

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 08:48:56
Hello `@Diego Rojas`, I have never tried adding 7th axis linear track, but here are a few ideas. `TrajectoryFollower` can control any motor present in the robot. Therefore, you can add the linear track (built with `SliderJoint` which behaves in the same way as the prismatic joint) in the Webots robot model.



Alternatively, you can use `ConveyorBelt` but it is more complicated. You need to enable a `Supervisor` field of your robot and extend `trajectory_follower` to control `speed` field of `ConveyorBelt`. This will also require some basic integration to control the position of the belt as `ConveyorBelt` allows only a speed control.

##### Alessia Valle 01/06/2021 09:08:34
Hi `@Darko Lukić`, thank you again for the suggestions.  I also found on the ROS wiki website the diff\_drive\_controller  [http://wiki.ros.org/diff\_drive\_controller](http://wiki.ros.org/diff_drive_controller) but I don't know if it is useful for my purposes and if it can be used with Webots. Any idea? 

Moreover, I have another doubt about transforms and URDF. Actually I need the static transforms between the wheels, the base\_link and base\_laser to set up navigation. But how can I publish transforms without the URDF file? Do these frames take the name of the corresponding nodes on Webots?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/06/2021 09:20:51
You can use `diff_drive_controller` as well. Your objective is to publish `Odometry` topic and transforms that describe translation and orientation between `base_link` and `odom` frames. You can use `diff_drive_controller` or write one by yourself.



You don't need URDF to publish transforms. In general, `robot_state_publisher` uses URDF to publish `TransformStamped` ([http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry\_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html)) messages. However, you can publish those messages by yourself.

Hi, is there a way to move all the motors of the robot arm at the same time? For example, I would like to move the tool center point (tcp) of a ur5e in a straight line from x=0 m to x=5 m. Right now I call the  \_setPosition\_ function for each motor in a sequential order with the inverse kinematics result, and judging from the movement, the  tcp is not moving in a straight line. Especially at the start of the movement, the arm jitters. I suspect it's caused by the asynchronous movement of the motors.

I want to use the supervisor function as well as the Robot node , therefore should I write ——

And should define as -

supervisor = Supervisor() 

 

Please help me with this !?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 12:27:32
If you set the motor positions in the single step they all move at the same time. Your problem is therefore something else. For example, the motor in shoulder moves the endpoint faster than the motor in the wrist even though they rotate at the same speed (the motor in the shoulder is farther away from the endpoint than the motor in the wrist). One solution would be to find a lot of IK solutions along a straight line and apply the new IK solution in each step.


No. `robot = Supervisor()` is enough. It will give you methods from `Robot` and `Supervisor` nodes.

##### Alessia Valle 01/07/2021 12:34:06

The most effective way to turn an epuck2 is by using time and angular speed itself. You may want to have a look at the proto file and take into account the thickness of the wheels among the other things to get a more accurate value of axle length.

##### ArjunSadananda 01/07/2021 21:41:23

I am sorry, but currently deploying a streaming server is not very easy, has some bugs and also is not very well documented. We are currently working on improving this, but it will take some time. Meanwhile, I am afraid, you will have to debug this kind of problem by yourself.

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab-language=python)


timestep = getBasicTimeStep()

so in ms, that's why you have to multiply by 1000

`@Simon Steinmann` Thank you. Succeeded in receiving the position value!!.

But I control the webots through ros. Is there a way to get time from ros topic or service?

##### Ragemor 01/08/2021 10:14:59
Excuse me is there any Webots project about multi robot coordination using leader follower approach? I want to implement leader follower algorithm in my project but i cant understand how can i write code about that. Which nodes and api functions(or sensors) should i use? Do you have docs about leader follower and multi robots in webots?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/08/2021 10:19:44
No, we don't have any documentation about leader follower and I am not aware of any project about it.


Maybe this one can help? [http://www.diegoantognini.com/projects/dis/](http://www.diegoantognini.com/projects/dis/)

##### Ragemor 01/08/2021 14:00:31
Thank you. If anyone have an idea or doc about leader follower can share with me?

##### adamadam333 01/08/2021 14:23:25
could someone give me a hand with rotating an EPUCK2 robot by 90 degrees? Tried absolutely everything and nothing worked, I am a complete beginner so don't know much


and there are no resources online for it


would be very helpful


I could pay for a call teaching me on how to do it

##### Maheed 01/08/2021 14:40:49
Hi everyone, Im a webots beginner at the moment. I have 8 yamor modules connected together to look like a snake and I really need some help to program some controllers in C to make it do something such as move towards an a certain colour or avoid obstacles. Can anyone help me with this?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/08/2021 14:44:57
are you dead set on c?

##### Maheed 01/08/2021 14:46:30
Yep

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/08/2021 14:47:47
Then I wont be able to help much. But my approach would be to create basic functionality as "move forward" "turn left" "turn right" etc. And then combine those into algorithms for obstacle avoidance etc.

##### Maheed 01/08/2021 15:27:37
Okay thanks


Is there anyone here good with C who can help me with this please?

##### linexc 01/08/2021 23:58:08
Hello everyone, I have a problem regarding Webots and NAO robot. I am trying to write a ROS server and client in order to make the NAO in Webots perform some gestures. But when I tried to simulate it, the error showed always like this. But I really don't know why the network address in already in use. If anybody can help me, I would be very grateful.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/09/2021 08:26:26
`@linexc` looks like a network problem. I have no experience with this exact thing, but usually you would use localhost


which should be 127.0.0.1

thank you. I will try it now.

##### Chernayaten 01/09/2021 19:36:59
I am messing around with the pen.wbt example and I found that the floorSize and the floorTileSize have to match (for example 1 1 for both or 4 4) . Can someone explain why?


Also if anyone can help me figuring out how to make the robot(still using the one in pen.wbt) turn 90 degree angles..atm I am using setRotate(getTargetPosition() +/- Rotate) where Rotate = 2*math.pi +0.4. Not sure why 0.4 works, but it seems ok in general, except if I use a big time\_step and sometimes when I left the simulation run a while.



I feel like I should be able to use 1.0/3.0, 4.0/3.0 and stuff like that to get different angles, but I can't make it work

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 00:37:29
Hello everyone! Playing with lights and lighting in Webots.  I have placed three line follower robots using the same controller, I still don't understand how it works.  Can someone tell me how it works?

[https://youtu.be/jMzKwcVs\_08](https://youtu.be/jMzKwcVs_08)

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:37:11
`@DrakerDG` Hey, what part exactly don't you understand?

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 12:41:40
`@Simon Steinmann` hello! I don't understand how by duplicating or tripling the same robot (copy & paste) they can use the same controller separately.  What I mean is that I just copied and pasted them without changing anything and it worked.  Each robot can follow the line without affecting the other.  In the end I only changed the color of the chassis and nothing else.  I see that it works but I don't understand how


I understood that each robot should have its own controller, but apparently it is not entirely necessary

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:50:15
Ah okay, I understand the confusion. Each robot runs its own instance of that controller. In a separate process


does that make sense?

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 12:53:45
`@Simon Steinmann` yes, thank you 😁👍🏼


`@Simon Steinmann` like as running the same application several times


`@Simon Steinmann` If it were different robots if each one is configured with their controller, right?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:56:16
yes


Usually a Controller is specific to one Robot, but you can have many instances of that Robot


you can take a look at your task-manager while running it. You should see the main Webots process, and then at least one per running controller.

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 12:58:23
`@Simon Steinmann` For example robots that play soccer use the same controller all, so

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/10/2021 12:58:30
I mostly use Python and often need similar functionality. So I have sub-modules or scripts, which I dont change and can use in different controllers by simply importing them

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 12:59:09
Ok

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/10/2021 13:00:01
If you have one type of robot player, then yes, it would make sense to use the same controller. Or at least a shared base-version for stuff like movement, sensors etc.


The roles for behavior, if they should differ, could be put on top of that


What Programming language do you use?

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 13:01:05
I will continue playing and I will try to make modules as you indicate.  It's very interesting


I am currently programming in C language, but I am learning in a course to start writing in Python


`@Simon Steinmann` My object is to use Webots to test robot designs, observe their operation, mechanical behavior, improve it and then physically build the robot

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/10/2021 13:14:31
Python is definitely easier and quicker imho

##### DrakerDG 01/10/2021 13:17:40
`@Simon Steinmann`  definitely yes, the syntax is very friendly.  In the little that I have advanced I really like how simple it is


`@Simon Steinmann` Thank you very much for guiding me

would anyone know what the issue is? Thanks

##### adiagr 01/10/2021 17:30:24
The error for sure pertains to the robot window's javascript file. I'm also experiencing the same error with Webots 2021 version. Went through the changelog but couldn't find anything pertaining to webots.js

##### AdityaDutt 01/10/2021 17:30:50
should I stick with 2020 instead?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/10/2021 17:37:41
The robot window doesn't rely on webots.js. Could you tell me which world are you trying to open?

##### AdityaDutt 01/10/2021 17:39:01
I am using the erebus challenge world. [https://github.com/Shadow149/Erebus](https://github.com/Shadow149/Erebus). Under erebus-aura>game>worlds>GeneratedWorld.wbt


well i went back to 2020a rev 1 and the error is no longer there

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/10/2021 21:00:41
`@AdityaDutt` , `@adiagr`  I have just checked and `MainSupervisorWindows.html` is not valid HTML file, so `webots` cannot be injected. The file content should be something like:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <script src="MainSupervisorWindow.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

##### adiagr 01/10/2021 21:03:17
Hey, in a robot window plugin, should the js file be explicitly included using the script tag?

Yes


You can check the e-puck example:

##### Diego Rojas 01/10/2021 23:30:11
What are the steps of designing a model for webots simulation? What is the process of designing something in soldworks and making a PROTO from the mesh? This is likely a simple question, but I cannot seem to find a direct answer or demo.

Take a look at this first: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

In general, the simplest way in my opinion, would be to build up your model in webots, then export the robot as a .wbo


then you just need to add the .proto header (as described in the link)

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:07:52
Hello Team Webots


i have a question related to webots


just visited the official website and then github and now i am here


Hi `@Darko Lukić`  how are you? remember me?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:11:47
I am sorry, I cannot recognize your username 🙁

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:12:22
i am Jamal Shams Khanzada, couple of days ago i had asked you a question on github and you helped me


and i am thankful to you


i am here for another problem to be solved.


can you still help me to solve it?


actually when i fetched gyro data recently, i started to make controller but it needs numpy

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:14:09
I recall now! I am glad I was able to help.


Feel free to ask a question and I, or somebody from the team, or the community, will probably be able to help you

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:18:34
so when i imported numpy it says "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'"


although i have installed python latest version

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:23:46
You installed `numpy` for Python2, not Python3


You need to `pip3 install numpy`

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:24:31
ok i am installing


but how can i know that `numpy` is for python2 or python 3?


installed it


rebooting is necessary or not?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:26:11
No, just restart the controller


In general (not necessary), if you install it with `pip3` it is for Python3, if you install it with `pip` it is for Python2.

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:27:33
ok


i restaretd the controller but the problem is still there

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:30:08
Do you get an error if you call?

```py
python3 -c 'import numpy'
```

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:30:28
let me check it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:30:57
`@JSK` did you maybe install Webots from the snap?

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:31:31
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  yes i installed it from snap

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:32:02
Ok, then you should use extern controller:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers)

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:32:52
negative... i got no error

%end

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:34:13
If you installed Webots as `snap` it will not work. As `@Stefania Pedrazzi` suggested you should use external controller or install Webots as a Debian package.

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:35:26
i checked that site. i have been reading it for two days but i was actually avoiding external controller. but now i think i have to switch here on external controller


i think i should go for Debian package


isn't it necessary that Debian should be installed on latest version of Ubuntu (20.04) i am using (18.04)


i have started downloading Debian Version.


and until it is downloaded i think i should reread the documentation `@Stefania Pedrazzi` mentioned me

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:42:32
There is a debian package version for Ubuntu 18.04: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots-R2021a-x86-64\_ubuntu-18.04.tar.bz2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots-R2021a-x86-64_ubuntu-18.04.tar.bz2)

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:43:55
Thank you . I am so thankful to you. 🙂

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:44:16
You're welcome

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:44:20
aaaa one last question please


after the file is downloaded, how to install it? i mean should i extract the `tar.bz2` extension file or something else?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:45:58
Oops.. I linked to the tarball instead of the debian package

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:46:00
please don't mind i am a novice

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 10:46:42
The tarball just needs to be extracted and then you can launch it from the directory where you extracted it


Here is the link to the debian package: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots\_2021a\_amd64.deb](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/download/R2021a/webots_2021a_amd64.deb)

Double clicking on it should open the Software Application window to install it

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:47:34
alright that sounds good

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:48:29
`@JSK` You may also have to set environment variables, especially when using conda

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:49:42
yeah i read about environment variables in the documentation that `@Stefania Pedrazzi`  mentioned

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:51:02
you can launch webots from a terminal. it will have the variables of that terminal

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:51:44
to be honest i tried to set the variables but when i started to search `usr/local/webots` i was not able to find that and hence i came on this platform for help. i am trying this for 3 days

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:52:11
you can edit your .bashrc in your home folder to add variables

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:53:05
what does "edit" mean.


?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:53:17
open it in a text editor and add the variables


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python)


here is more detail

##### JSK 01/11/2021 10:54:51
alright

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 10:57:26
you can add this at the end of your .bashrc

`export WEBOTS\_HOME="/home/simon/webots"

export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH="${LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller"

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller/python38"

export PYTHONIOENCODING="UTF-8"`

keep in mind to change the first line to the correct Path of your installation, and change the python version to the correct one


`python3 --version`  to get your python3 version

##### JSK 01/11/2021 11:00:44
thanks let me do it

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:00:45
the .bashrc file gets sourced every time you open a new terminal. So you have to open a new terminal for it to take effect. Then you can launch webots from the terminal, and it will have those variables

##### JSK 01/11/2021 11:03:18
can you tell me how to access .bashrc file? i cant find it

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:03:28
it's hidden


ctrl + h to see hidden files, or `gedit ~/.bashrc` in the terminal

##### JSK 01/11/2021 11:04:05
found it


updated .bashrc as you mentioned `@Simon Steinmann` .

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:07:37
now you can open a new terminal and launch webots from there. the variables should be set


Instead of setting those variables in the .bashrc, you could set them in `sudo gedit /etc/profile`. That should set them system wide

Hello everyone! I would like to write a controller that allows my robot to keep the lane. What sensors do you suggest me to use?

##### MartinG 01/11/2021 11:10:33
Use a camera sensor and look into canny edge detection and hough line transform


I don't know your programming language preference, but I strongly recommend you use python since OpenCV makes it a much easier task than it seems.

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/11/2021 11:11:27
Something like this?

[https://github.com/lukicdarkoo/webots-example-lane-follower](https://github.com/lukicdarkoo/webots-example-lane-follower)


It is not robust, but it is very simple

##### Alessia Valle 01/11/2021 11:16:30
Yes, but I have never used OpenCV


Are there any references on Cyberbotics website?

##### MartinG 01/11/2021 11:19:03
I used a really solid (imo) guide that has some hand holding but also allows for you to figure the problems out by yourself, you can find it here [https://towardsdatascience.com/deeppicar-part-1-102e03c83f2c](https://towardsdatascience.com/deeppicar-part-1-102e03c83f2c)


Parts 3 and 4 are what you'll probably find the most useful.


And it does put up a paywall after 3 visits to the site I believe, but a bit of incognito browsing never hurt anyone.


I have a question of my own, using reset simulation crashes the whole program. The world is quite complex, however even leaving it to run for a long while after hitting reset doesn't seem to help.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/11/2021 11:23:12
Perhaps try removing things from the world one by one and hit reset after. Try to find out what is causing the crash

##### Alessia Valle 01/11/2021 11:25:21
Thank you!

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 16:42:55
Hi again! I am trying to create a robot class with the motors, position sensors, and other stuff included in it. I am using this code:

```C++
class myRobot {
  public:
    Robot *robot;
    Motor *left;
    Motor *right;
    PositionSensor *LEnc;
    PositionSensor *REnc;
    int timeStep;
};
```

It says that 'Robot' does not specify a type, and same with 'Motor' and 'PositionSensor'. I suspect this is because something in Robot.hpp is not public.


I'm sort of a noob with C++ and OOP, so I'm not really sure what the issue is

Would you perhaps be able to help me with the following? I want my robot to make a 90 degree clockwise turn which. I use setPosition to increment/decrement and thus move/turn the robot. I use a position sensor to properly stagger my commands so they don't overlap.



With my subpar trigonometry skills I figured that to turn the robot 90 degrees I have to inc/dec the position by (math.pi * robot\_radius)/ (2*wheel\_radius) . My simulations say I am completely wrong. Can you help me out? I can show how I reached the formula if you want

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 21:53:28
funny I was doing the same thing today. This is the formula I landed on, and it works:

```
theta(in radians) = 
(angle(in degrees) * robot_radius * pi)/(360 * wheel_radius)
```


so if your robot radius(something you sort of have to play with to get accurate results) is 32.5, and wheel radius is 9.5, then your setPosition should be(in radians) (90 * 32.5 * PI)/(360*9.5)


pretty sure you forgot to multiply your angle and it should be 360*wheel\_rad

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:01:55
What do you mean it is something that I have to play around to get accurate results? Why?


Your formula translates to my\_formula / 2 since 90/360 = 1/4. Unfortunately the turn my robot does is still wrong

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 22:14:02
it's not actually supposed to be the robot radius, it's meant to be the distance between the centers of the wheels, which is usually smaller than the robot radius given on the webots website


what does it do then?

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:15:37
Ahh.. yeah, I agree. The center of my wheels is right on the edge of the robot, in which case the distance should be the robot radius

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 22:16:01
if it is extremely far off then there's something wrong with the formula


but if instead of 90 degrees it goes 80 or 100 degrees, then just mess with the robot radius


basically what my formula does is the following(90 degrees as an example)

1. 90/360 =1/4 shows that you are going 1/4 of the circumference.

2. calculate circumference through robot\_diameter*pi, and multiply by 1/4(or whatever fraction you got from step 1). This gives you the distance that each wheel has to go in terms of cm.


then the radians that each wheel has to turn is distance/wheelRadius


putting all that together gives the final formula

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:22:44
1/4 gives me a ~43.6 turning angle, 1/2 gives me a ~45.2 angle and 1/1 (so a full circle supposedly) gives me ~62 angle

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 22:23:01
ooh


yeah


that's not right


this is what I have:

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:23:29
I do agree with your reasoning on how it works though

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 22:23:34
```
(angle*WHEELBASE*PI)/(360*WHEELRAD)
```


WHEELBASE is the robot diameter


try that


and angle is in degrees

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:26:14
This is what I am trying. btw my result was in radians, I just converted it to angle so that it makes more sense. At least for me, angles feel far more natural when it comes to visualizing them

##### AdityaDutt 01/11/2021 22:26:15
*wheelbase is robot \_diameter\_, not radius


in case that was a matter of confusion


ok what's your wheelbase(\_diameter\_) and wheel radius

##### Chernayaten 01/11/2021 22:30:20
I'm pretty sure my wheelbase is the same as my robot diameter which is 0.9 and my wheel radius is 0.025.


My wheels are located on 0.045 to the left and the right of my robot, wheelbase is calculated as the distance from the center of the wheels which makes that 0.09


I'm using the robot from the pen.wbt world in the Devices Tour


I'll try playing around with the values to see if I can make it work. Thanks for taking the time, at least I know that my logic is not too far off

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 07:11:18
Just reporting. I think I found a bug (not sure), but receiving the message from the simulation server, when starting the Stream class another bar '/' is inserted in line 6 and the link becomes 'localhost:2001//mjpeg' ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/f6ebe9cf8ce64c30cf453655376a815deeb28744/resources/web/wwi/stream.js#L6](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/f6ebe9cf8ce64c30cf453655376a815deeb28744/resources/web/wwi/stream.js#L6)) . For the x3d option the problem does not happen weirdly.


I am solving that by changing the message sent from the simulation server. I will check if it will also work with 'x3d' option or if using this solution only solves the 'mjpeg' but starts the error when using 'x3d'.

`@AdityaDutt` `@Chernayaten`  [http://www.hmc.edu/lair/ARW/ARW-Lecture01-Odometry.pdf](http://www.hmc.edu/lair/ARW/ARW-Lecture01-Odometry.pdf) Take a look at this lecture presentation. Especially slide 23


delta-Theta is the angle change of the robot (you want 90° (pi/2)

delta-s  is the distance traveled by the right / left wheel

2L is the distance between wheels. (as a note here, yesterday I found more accurate results using the outside edge to outside edge distance distance of the BoundingObject of the wheels, not the wheel center)


So solving for the difference in angles/position of your wheels, the formula should be like this:

`delta_pos = delta_theta * wheelBase / wheelRadius`


Now you can put in any theta angle in radians and get the delta\_pos


delta\_pos is how much more you have to turn one wheel over the other


I recommend staying with radians all the times. The only exception maybe being when printing a message. Then just multiply an angle by 180/pi  to get degrees

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:22:18
I followed the page, re-build webots, also installed the optional dependencies, but still nothing on the wwi/dependencies folder... should I download the dependencies in that folder manually?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/12/2021 09:23:19

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:24:25
yups.. webots built successfully, i can open v2021a


i am trying to check a possible bug in the multimedia\_client.js file

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/12/2021 09:24:56
okay... and what is the issue?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 09:27:01
`@Luiz Felipe` Can you check whether you have node/npm installed, `npm --version`. If there is a missing dependency `make` skips compiling the corresponding part. Node should be included in the optional dependencies, but just to make sure whether it is properly installed

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:28:28
Probably that is the reason `@Darko Lukić` (npm is installed correctly but probably make skipped that when i ran the command)


does make clear works to re-build one more time?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 09:29:20
Yes, `make clean` works

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 09:29:39
`make clean`

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 09:29:59
Correct, sorry

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:30:15
Thanks =), I will re-build

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 09:30:18
Or even more powerful `make cleanse` (will remove the dependencies).

##### Luiz Felipe 01/12/2021 09:31:38
For the web part, is there a list of bugs or features that need help? (I dont know much of javascript but I feel that part is really breakthrough work in  webots)


Now I got the dependencies `@Darko Lukić` . Thank you very much. I got an error during make regarding the npm but all the dependencies seems to be in the /dependencies folder.

##### Apashe 01/12/2021 10:49:21
Hello everyone! recently started working with webots and I wanted to know how to get the current coordinates of the robot and point it to some point so that it gets there (I'm currently working with a robot "iRobot's Create")

how can this be done and is there an example?

now I want the robot to be able to drive from one current coordinate to another (without obstacles) on Rectangle Arena

##### Chernayaten 01/12/2021 10:50:09
GPS can get you current coordinates


Assuming you know the direction of your robot you can easily calculate the distance and the angle to your target

##### Apashe 01/12/2021 11:01:14
there are examples of how to use GPS

##### Chernayaten 01/12/2021 11:03:10
Yes, there's a gps.wbt file under the devices section.



GPS is simple to use, you can also check out its section oncthe webots site to see all the methods in your preferred language

##### owongcho 01/12/2021 16:39:37
hello! what type of simulation Webots generates? For example, is the type of simulation an emulation, discrete event simulation, or something else?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/12/2021 16:41:49
I would say emulation. The time is simulated and there is a fixed time step.

##### owongcho 01/12/2021 17:43:03
I see. thank you `@Olivier Michel`

##### Chernayaten 01/12/2021 19:14:50
Thanks for the information. I haven't looked at the lecture yet, but I will do so soon. I actually came to the same result as you, the outside distance seems to work better for some reason.



I also suspect that the initial anchor positions from the given example are wrong, unless I am mistaken. From Tutorial 6 on the 4 wheeled robot, the anchor field of the HingeJointParameters node should have the same values as the Solid translation one, but the robot of the pen.wbt world is missing the x values.



I'll review your information and hopefully get a good result. Thanks again (:

##### AdityaDutt 01/13/2021 00:49:06
I have the pioneer 3dx robot in between two walls. What would be a good way to ensure that the robot is straight/aligned with the wall? I tried checking two side sensors and making sure they return very similar values, or adjusting until they do, but the distance sensors are very noisy and not consistent much.

How do I make sure the robot is straight?

##### TerryWr1st 01/13/2021 01:37:07
Have you specified a noise value in the sensor lookup table? Otherwise they should be accurate. 



Also, when your robot is in the above orientation, the distance sensor rays will be sent out on an angle (not perpendicular to walls as desired), which will increase/decrease your sensor values. So you would need to know your robot orientation for this approach as well

##### AdityaDutt 01/13/2021 01:37:32
wdym specify noise value?


I can pick how little/much noise I want?


and oh yeah I didn't think about the angle thing thanks

##### TerryWr1st 01/13/2021 01:41:31
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)



Scroll down to the lookup table section

##### AdityaDutt 01/13/2021 01:42:37
wait so I can set my own noise stuff?


in code?


But if some competition is using webots that i'm participating in, what stops me from just setting 0 noise


how do I change the lookuptable values

##### TerryWr1st 01/13/2021 02:06:16
If the competition hasn't mentioned a restriction on sensor accuracy then dont set a noise. 



From the documentation, first column is sensor input, second column is what you want the input to represent, third column is the noise value. 



You can change these values in the scene tree (expand the fields of your distance sensor), or open the wbt file with a text editor

##### AdityaDutt 01/13/2021 03:05:56

##### Wasabi Fan 01/13/2021 04:52:17
I have a small projectile (on the order of 1cm diameter in the real world) that I'd like to simulate at moderate-to-fast speeds (tens of m/s) and detect contact with a particular square surface on a target robot. This is currently using a `TouchSensor`. Unfortunately, even with a projectile a few times larger and speeds a fraction of real-world, the simulation time step is too large to consistently (or, at higher speeds, essentially at all) have a time slice in which the projectile is actually intersecting the target. In other words, the collision is never detected. This is true even if I up the simulation speed to thousands of Hz, which isn't practical anyway. As far as I can gather, TouchSensor collision detection is purely based on intersection after a discrete time step.



One solution which seems technically possible but perhaps not practical is some form of intra-step interpolation (e.g., a ray intersection check which approximates my projectile as a point -- my understanding is that ODE supports this in some form).  What are others' thoughts here? And is there actually a practical means of implementation for the above in my Webots sim, with or (ideally) without a physics plugin? Alternately, this seems to be approaching the scale at which doing a purely mathematical hit-test without ever simulating the projectile may make more sense -- however, I \_do\_  need to simulate the time-of-flight, and I'm not sure what API would be sensible for computing those collisions, if any.

##### Luiz Felipe 01/13/2021 04:56:55
`@Wasabi Fan` , does decreasing the time step does not work even implementing a collision detector using a physics plugin following: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/introduction-of-the-physics-plugins](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/introduction-of-the-physics-plugins) ?

##### Wasabi Fan 01/13/2021 05:01:28
I tried that once with a "normal" time-step (~60Hz) and it did not seem to change the results. Setting up the toolchain to compile physics plugins is a bit of extra work (which I preferred to not introduce into my general setup process), which is why I haven't done a lot of experimenting with it, but it's not out of the question. However, it's not clear to me what that sample plugin is intended to do -- is there an expectation that the joint-attachment collision handling is better in a scenario like this?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 07:11:38
A possible solution (without a physics plugin) would be to turn the bullet into a Robot with the supervisor field set to TRUE. Then, add a distance sensor to the bullet looking backwards. At each time step, you should get the current position of the bullet and compute the vector between the current position and the previous position. You will use this vector to change the orientation of the distance sensor so that it looks exactly at the previous position and make a sensor measurement in the same time step. If the distance measured is smaller than the distance between the current and previous position, then a collision occurred and you should set the position of the bullet at the place of collision (which can easily be computed along the distance sensor ray).

##### Wasabi Fan 01/13/2021 07:16:36
Oh wow, that's very inventive and \_sounds\_ workable. I think there are some details I'd need to work out but I shall try that in the next few days and report back if I run into issues. Thanks!

What is the problem?

##### Chernayaten 01/13/2021 11:44:30
The anchor field of the HingeJointParameters node is 0 0.025 0 whereas the Solid node (for the wheel) is -0.045 0.025 0 (and 0.045 for the other wheel)


This is in the Pen device example

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 11:49:28
This is correct, but is it not essential as the anchor may be anywhere on the rotation axis. However, you are right it is better to have it as close as possible to the rotating part (the wheel in this case) for stability reasons.

Hi, can someone help me about boundingObject Box ? I'm using a Free 3D Butter Stick model in a simulation (that will be part of a robotics immersion week in college), but the mesh has probably some internal conflicts, so if I use it as the boundingObject Box the Solid will actually tilt out of the screen.

My solution is use a box shape as the bounding box, since I dont need the object to be precisely cut. Anyway, when I put the Box as the boundingObject Box, it wont go to the center of the object, and, no matter how I change the dimensions of the Box, it wont fit the object as wished. So, here is my question: Can I move the "center" (in relation to the object)  of a boundingObject Box ?


here is the pic of the uncentered boundingObject Box

PS: I'm on Ubuntu

You can add the `Box` node in a `Transform` node.

##### Kirlin 01/14/2021 19:56:45
Can you describe more how I do this ? I've never used a Transform node

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/14/2021 19:59:54
It should be `boundingObject > Transform > children > Box`

##### Kirlin 01/14/2021 20:06:42
Wow, this is so useful, helped me pretty out, thanks so much!!

##### Wasabi Fan 01/15/2021 02:32:14
I'm taking a look at this in more depth, and now realize one part of my desired functionality is that I know \_what\_ the projectile hit. There is a particular surface on the robot (at the moment, I'm enclosing it in a TouchSensor boundary) which is being aimed at, and other parts of the robot (or elements of the surroundings) \_aren't\_ something I want to detect. In fact, at these speeds, there's some risk of going \_through\_ the robot and seeing the other target on the back of that robot.



I think this could be solved if there is a way to know what object the distance sensor is seeing -- is this a possibility? One option we see is to add a `Recognition` on a camera, with small FOV, pointing in the same direction as the distance sensor, and use that to disambiguate. I think it \_should\_ work, minus approximation error for the bounding boxes and any perf hit. Is there a more sensible way?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/15/2021 08:19:14
Yes, this should work but it looks a bit overkill. Instead of this, you could add `TouchSensor` nodes in the walls and when you move back the bullet into the wall, this touch sensor would be activated so that you know which wall was hit.

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 08:37:13
`@Wasabi Fan` I'd recommend taking a more mathematical approach to this, it would execute quite a bit faster than using all kinds of sensors and what not. If you can get the current position of both the projectile and your robot and you know the size of both of them, it's as easy as a couple if conditions to check for a collision.


There's a ton of information on collision detection online, however if you have any specific issue, I'd be glad to help.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/15/2021 08:58:34
Perhaps try running it without the displays. That is a lot of memory. Sounds to me like a lot of visual data is cumulatively buffered. You could also share your project (you can pm me too) and I'll have a look.


Oh and I have some experience with RL and Webots too, just fyi 🙂

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/15/2021 09:08:49
In the Webots source code there is CCD functionality (Continuous collision detection). This would probably solve this problem. `@Olivier Michel` Is it possible to use that collision detection method? Either through a plugin or custom compile?

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 09:13:26
Where can I find it? I'd like to look through it.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/15/2021 09:17:42
I suspected as much. I hope something along these lines is somewhere on the roadmap. This is one of the few areas, where Webots is behind its competition: The low level control of physic engine settings and choice of different collision detection methods.


But I understand that it is not the highest priority and a lot of work

I think that the problem is in your last line of code, f=Node.addForce(hf,force,relative=False)

##### yash 01/15/2021 10:01:15
yes but how to rectify it

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 10:01:22
You're calling addForce from the Node object instead of on the node that you want it to be executed on.


actually no


try changing f to hf


I saw that you defined the foot as hf before the while loop


That is most likely your problem.

##### yash 01/15/2021 10:04:06
so should I define hf=robot.getFromDef("human\_foot")   in the while loop ?

##### MartinG 01/15/2021 10:04:31
No, in your last line just put an h before f


hf=Node.addForce(hf,force,relative=False)


I’m not sure that will work, but f doesn’t exist prior to that so it’s a likely cause.

##### yash 01/15/2021 10:05:46

Robots are located under \Webots\projects\robots . From there you can navigate to the robot you can and find the protos folder (if there is one) and find the proto file you want. So for example the Create robot proto file for me is located under "C:\Program Files\Webots\projects\robots\irobot\create\protos" and the e-puck one under " C:\Program Files\Webots\projects\robots\gctronic\e-puck\protos"

How can we access individual value inside the SFVEC3F in proto files?

Or

position IS frontRightLeg[0]


These both gave errors

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/18/2021 11:02:58
You cannot based on the `IS` keyword. Instead, you should rely on Lua scripting to extract the individual components of a `SFVec3f`.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/18/2021 11:04:34
OK than instead 

position IS frontRightLegHip


Where frontRightLegHip is SFFLOAT


This should work

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/18/2021 17:13:46
Probably depends on how visually accurate you want it. The simplest method I can imagine, is using a texture of the field, and then paining with the Pen node on top of that picture, where the tractor has harvested

##### Homeralf 01/18/2021 23:56:27
Hi guys,



I would like to thank the team for this great simulator, the API and documentation are so great. 

I'm a hobbyist trying to develop a muscle-based robot and I've encountered a couple of issues.



I want to carry a simulation from a single python process.

As far as I know, each robot's external controller must be contained in its own process, so I spawn multiple processes from the main process (with the corresponding environment variables).

The actual problem comes when sharing data among processes. The objects I try to share can't be pickled (serialized) because they contain SwigPyObjects. I can solve this but is cumbersome and not idiomatic.



So I have a couple of questions I hope you can help me with:

Is there a way to run controllers without spawning additional processes?

I guess the serialization problem can't be solved because of Swig, however, I think an update on the python API is on the roadmap. It is possible this may solve this issue?





Thanks in advance!

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 08:19:41
`@Homeralf` Taking a step back, why do you want it to run from the same process? What data do you want to share?


In general [https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) can work really well for parallel processing and data sharing. Then there is middlewares such as ROS. Webots itself has the Transmitter and Receiver node, which you can use to send data between Robots

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/19/2021 08:45:08
Hello `@Homeralf`. I am glad you like Webots. As you mentioned, the objects cannot be serialized because of SWIG. If you saw PR with objective to move away from SWIG in favor of Python native bindings then I believe that will not solve your problem. Maybe we can do something like this:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9310053/how-to-make-my-swig-extension-module-work-with-pickle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9310053/how-to-make-my-swig-extension-module-work-with-pickle)


You cannot run the controllers in the same process

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 09:29:02
You also might want to take a look at pyro5. Could be exactly what you need

##### Homeralf 01/19/2021 09:42:57
Hello `@Simon Steinmann`



I want to run it from the same process because among other things I want to automate multiple simulations based on evolutionary algorithms.

The controllers must receive input from higher abstractions like the activations of the muscles, where the robot should be headed, the target speed of a solid, etc.



Yes, I was using the BaseManager from multiprocessing to share the data. However, it wouldn't work because the objects can't be serialized.

I would like to keep the project as lean as possible and I think using ROS may be a little bit overkill for now but I will consider it if things get complicated (I may be wrong).

Transceiver and receiver nodes seem like a good solution among robots.

Didn't know about pyro5, looks promising! I will give it a try!



Thanks for your time Simon, really appreciated it.


Hi `@Darko Lukić`,



Yes, that was the PR I saw.

Nice, looks exactly like the solution. I will try to implement it as soon as I get back from work.



Thanks for answering the questions, you've helped me a lot.

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 10:20:48
Hi guys, 

I'm building a tutorial for our software. The tutorial use Webots and ROS2. So far, so good. 

Basically, I have a scene with a UR5e robot and some objects. We execute some trajectories with the followJointTrajectory action.

I would like now to go further and to do so, I need to know the position of some Webots objects in ROS2. For example, the robot move a bottle and I would like to get the bottle position to be published in ROS2 through a geometry\_msgs::Pose. 

Any idea how I can achieve this using C++/ROS2 API?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/19/2021 10:29:20
`@gaitt` You can use Supervisor:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)



Do you use the `webots_ros2` package or you created your own interface?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:31:16
If you want positions of objects relative to others (your robot for example), then you can use this script I made. Or you can at least take inspiration from it and create it in c++

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 10:31:26
Yes I already use the  `webots_ros2` package.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:32:11
The supervisor only gives you absolute (world) coordinates. For inverse kinematics you usually need it realtive to the robot base


If you end up creating something like this in c++, it would be nice if you could share

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 10:38:43
Thanks `@Simon Steinmann`, well absolute position is what I need.


I was thinking there was an easier solution that writing a new ROS2 node.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 10:40:46
You need a supervisor controller (can be your ur5e). It can then get and publish the positions of anything in the simulation

Hi ! I am using wb\_motor\_get\_torque\_feedback(),  to get torque of motors for a 2R manipulator. But the function returns me the same value of torque for all the motors ? What could be the issue ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 11:47:41
can you post your code or controller file?

you use the same motor


that might be it 😉

I would like to plot these values , how can it be done ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 11:59:24
double click on the robot, it should be plotted there


the robot window

##### yash 01/19/2021 12:06:07
No, but these are values that give torque feedback and doesn’t take any sensor into Accout


account*

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 12:06:56
then you have to either make a custom robot window, or plot it yourself with a python library


or use external IDEs

##### yash 01/19/2021 12:08:01
understood, I am using matplotlib, but I plot them with respect to time right i.e robot.step(timestep)?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 12:08:51
time = robot.getTime()

##### yash 01/19/2021 12:09:06
oh okay

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 12:09:17
that is the simulation time you see in Webots

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 15:07:29
Can I retrieve a Supervisor from an already running instance of webots?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/19/2021 15:23:29
A supervisor is used like the robot node. So you have to start a controller of a robot, which has supervisor = true checkmark in the scene tree


And instead of robot =Robot() you do robot = Supervisor()

##### gaitt 01/19/2021 15:37:11
Ok I managed to get it! It look likes, if webots is running I can't get the handle. I need first to create the supervisor and then launch webots to get the handle properly. Now let see how to parse the rootNode ...

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/20/2021 08:49:55
`@gaitt` A supervisor needs to be initialized. For that a robot controller needs to be launched. Usually all robots controllers are launched, when the simulation starts. Through the use of a supervisor controller, you can start and stop other controllers. But I dont think you can start your first supervisor controller later on in the simulation.


You should also always have this open in a tab: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python)

You'll have to reference it constantly. Luckily it is very detailed. Also remember, that the `Supervisor() `also has all the functionality of `Robot()`. So you dont have to change any of your existing code, should you chose to turn your ur5e into a supervisor. All motor / sensor controls work the same

##### Majanao 01/20/2021 11:31:45
Hi all, I would like to balance the camera of the DJI Mavic. Is it possible to rotate it through a python script or do I have to add two motors to the drone model?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 11:33:53
Sure, this is possible. You will have to edit the drone model (PROTO file) to add this capability.


In fact, you don't need to edit the drone model. Instead you should create a pan tilt camera proto and add it in the `cameraSlot` of the Mavic2Pro model so that it is used instead of the default `Camera` node.

##### Majanao 01/20/2021 11:53:47
Thanks a lot. I'll try that.

##### gaitt 01/20/2021 17:15:06
`@Simon Steinmann` Ok I see. Thanks a lot. 

Another question: can we add other sensors to a predefined robot. I use the predefined UR5e and so the controller is external. 

My goal would be to add a fixed rangefinder to the UR5e base and access it from my ROS2 node to process the depth image.


BTW, is there somewhere a piece of code to transform a rangefinder depth image to 3d points in world coordinate frame?

##### Apashe 01/20/2021 17:28:43

but I don't have the full turn angle converge (I do it through the values PositionSensor)

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 17:31:46
`@Apashe` This may help:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-E-puck-for-ROS2-Beginners#differential-drive-calibration](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/wiki/Tutorial-E-puck-for-ROS2-Beginners#differential-drive-calibration)


Yes, you can add any node to `toolSlot`


```py
def depth2pointcloud(depth_image, k_matrix):
    inv_fx = 1.0 / k_matrix[0, 0]
    inv_fy = 1.0 / k_matrix[1, 1]
    ox = k_matrix[0, 2]
    oy = k_matrix[1, 2]
    image_height, image_width = depth_image.shape
    points = np.zeros((image_width * image_height, 3), dtype=np.float32)
    counter = 0
    for y in range(image_height):
        for x in range(image_width):
            dist = depth_image[y, x]
            # This follows the coordinate system of the gripper
            points[counter, 1] = -np.float32((x - ox) * dist * inv_fx)
            points[counter, 2] = -np.float32((y - oy) * dist * inv_fy)
            points[counter, 0] = np.float32(dist)
            counter += 1
    return points[:counter].astype(np.float32)


def get_calibration_matrix_from_range_finder(range_finder):
    image_width = range_finder.getWidth()
    image_height = range_finder.getHeight()
    focal_length = 0.5 * image_width * (1 / math.tan(0.5 * range_finder.getFov()))
    k_matrix = np.array([
        [focal_length, 0, image_width / 2],
        [0, focal_length, image_height / 2],
        [0, 0, 0]
    ])
    return k_matrix


def get_point_cloud_from_range_finder(range_finder):
    depth_image = np.asarray(range_finder.getRangeImage(), dtype=np.float32)
    depth_image = depth_image.reshape((-1, range_finder.getWidth()))


    k_matrix = get_calibration_matrix_from_range_finder(range_finder)
    return depth2pointcloud(depth_image, k_matrix)
```

This snippet creates a point cloud in the range finder's reference frame.

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 17:39:55
I know, but the principle is the same. You rotate the robot and move it along the line to calibrate it

##### Apashe 01/20/2021 17:40:19
I used the standard example for PositionSensor from Webots and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSjTWcTojHg&t=536s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSjTWcTojHg&t=536s)

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 17:41:01
`@Apashe` 

```py
DEFAULT_WHEEL_RADIUS = 0.02
DEFAULT_WHEEL_DISTANCE = 0.05685
```

You can use these values

##### gaitt 01/20/2021 17:42:35
I did try `toolSlot` but as I expected it moves when the robot moves, I would like my rangefinder to be in a fixed frame

##### Apashe 01/20/2021 17:42:36
Thank you I'll go try it

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 17:43:33
I see, in that case you can add it in directly in the world

##### gaitt 01/20/2021 17:53:08
I'm not sure how, could you elaborate? Device node must belong to a robot node, right?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/20/2021 19:13:51
Yes, you would have two robot and two controllers, one of them just publishing the point cloud


Alternately, you can add the range finder to the UR PROTO directly

##### gaitt 01/21/2021 08:23:49

Hey Darko, so I have tried the first approach. I added a 2nd robot with only the kinect in it. The robot controller is set to extern, supervisor is true for all robot. But when I launch the "webots\_robotic\_arm\_node", it seems to me that the joint state publisher get stuck! My custom ROS2 node seems to behave correctly and is loaded as controller for the 2nd robot. Can we have multiple supervisor, 1 per robot?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/22/2021 10:40:21

<@132121297277812736> your mesh file seems to be faulty. How did you generate it? There is tools and programs that can fix meshes. Webots told you the things that might be wrong


And for boundingObject, it is always better to approximate it with a simple geometric shape, such as a sphere, box, cylinder etc. It will make the simulation more stable and much faster


Should fix your second issue too

Our robot has a set of omniwheels attached to encoders.  Each omniwheel can only rotate in one direction, but moves freely in the other direction.  This makes them ideal for capturing actual robot movement in the X and Y direction (we use this for position localization).  Does anyone have a suggestion for how best to model this in webots?    I could add a position sensor to a cylinder, but I worry that the drag in the other direction would mess things up.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [Cyberbotics] 01/25/2021 07:21:27
The red/pink bounding objects means that this objects is colliding with some other objects. Then, if the object doesn't move any longer, after a while the boundingObject will turn blue. Otherwise if there is no collision the boundingObject color is white.

##### yash 01/25/2021 08:32:49
Hi ! I am using def getTorqueFeedback() function to compute torque of a mani[pulator link. I set the max available torque by using the function setAvailableTorque() to 2N.  Then I supply a velocity to the motors. So when I note down the values from the torque feedback, the values are not constant ? Since providing constant velocity to the motor, the torque should also be constant right ?


Please help me regarding this.

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/25/2021 09:25:31
Thank you!

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/25/2021 10:29:08
Hold something in a stretched out arm at your side and lift it up until you hold it horizontally. The torque required at your shoulder changes constantly, even if you move at constant speed. When accelerating or compensating external forces (stretched out arm), you need more torque. Without load and a constant speed, you need no torque (or just a little bit to compensate for friction)

##### yash 01/25/2021 10:35:02
therefore , since the link has mass, so when actuating it at a constant velocity the torque will change ?

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/25/2021 13:54:21
if a link has no mass it theoretically requires no torque to accelerate, does any child of the link have any mass?

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:13:00
Yes the link has mass , so definitely it will require torque

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/25/2021 14:13:33
ah sorry i misread your message

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:14:04
I give constant velocity, so the torque should also be constant right ?


Given by gettorquefeedback() function

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/25/2021 14:16:36
lets assume there is no gravity, at the beginning of the motion you will need some torque to accelerate the joint, when the joint has reached its desired velocity, you might need some torque to overcome friction, at the end of the motion you will require some torque in the opposite direction to decelerate the joint


if you now have gravity, the joint has to apply torque to overcome that gravity pulling on the center of mass of the attached link, depending on the angle between the gravity vector pointing downwards and the angle of the joint to the link it will require more or less torque to overcome this force

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:21:31
Therefore as per your your statement , there will always be increase or decrease in the torque .?

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/25/2021 14:22:05
it depends on what external forces are acting on the link

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:22:24
Only the gravity

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:22:28
Just to make sure, do you understand what forces, torques, velocities and accelerations are? And how they interact with one another?

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:23:33
Yes.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:25:00
Okay, so lets assume an instance, where there is no gravity, and no friction. In this case, you only need torque to accelerate or decelerate. Remaining still,  or at constant velocity, requires no torque.


Is this clear, or is there something you want me to explain in more detail?

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:28:08
Oh okay , well understand !

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:29:13
Now we turn gravity on. It will pull on the link and joint. This creates torque in the joint, assisting or fighting against the motor. So the motor torque has to change

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:30:56
Alright , because of the gravity or some exeternal force !

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/25/2021 14:31:45
Just imagine, you would suddenly turn the motor off, and it would just be a joint without friction. Would anything fall down, slow down, speed up? If the answer is yes, the motor would have to apply a torque to counter that

##### yash 01/25/2021 14:32:55

Hello. Sorry to bother again with questions:



I'm trying to do a parallel manipulator, similar to the stewart platform, and i'm trying to close the kinematic loop. Like the stewart mechanism, this manipulator has a fixed platform and a mobile platform.



What i'm trying to do is defining the mobile platform. The mobile platform pose in space relative to the fixed is quite simple, but relative to the last joint is fairly complicated.

Is there any way to generate the mobile platform solid relative to the base (basically just making it a children of the robot node) while being a movable solid?



If I create the mobile platform as a children of the robot node, it won't move no matter how much force the actuators make. Also, if i remove all the links, the mobile platform just stays afloat, ignoring gravity. All solids in question have a physics node. On the other hand, if i create it as a child of the last joint, it behaves properly.



I tried to follow the stewart platform example, where they generate the mobile platform as a child of the last joint, but i was trying to avoid this path.



Thank you

Hi everyone! Hope you can help me with this, I have the 3d model of a specific traffic cone and I'm trying to put it some physics but im stuck with the bounding object.

First, I tried to use the mesh of the 3d model but when I run a sim im getting this error: "Your world may be too complex." that's obvious because the mesh got many faces.

Then I thought in using the cone geometry shape but apparently webots doesn't support the cone as a Bounding Object.

What do you suggest? Is there any way I can modify the default traffic cone of webots (because this one has physics)?

This is one of the cones I wanted to introduce in the sim:

a cone plus box at the bottom should do the trick

##### alejanpa17 01/25/2021 17:34:58
It does supports cones but not as a  Bounding Object.

Is there a method Webots to create a 'ghost' robot (pure pose transformation through space without the effects of gravity and collisions affecting it?). This is shown in the video below. The robot in the darker shade is present in the physical world, whereas the other one is a ghost [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWxIjtMMFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWxIjtMMFI)

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 06:56:38
Yes, this possible by creating a robot without physics and animating it from a supervisor controller.

Hello  there team


i am programming a controller for drone.


it takes of at 68.5


but i have given it more than 100 but it is not flying


motors are moving i.e. showing rotation


but the drone is not taking off


what could be the possible reason?


i am stuck here. need help

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 07:45:06
How did you create your drone model? Did you create it from the Mavic example?

##### JSK 01/26/2021 08:13:09
yes


Excuse me!

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 08:29:10
I would recommend you to revert back to the original drone model to check if it works with your controller and make changes step-by-step to identify where did the problem come from.

##### JSK 01/26/2021 09:30:03
Actually that drone is just imported in my\_first\_Simulation. it has nothing but just a drone. it is flying with "mavic2pro.c" controller but its not flying for mine. although  i have supplied rotor inputs. here is a screenshot of my envoirment.

Perhaps share your project. It's hard to tell otherwise

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 11:46:01
Is there a way to chain transform nodes in a bounding object? The bounding object allows a transform node with a shape child, I was wondering if there's a way to chain multiple transform nodes, where the last one has a shape child.


Or if there's a way to automatically compute the equivalent transform

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 11:48:08
With just translations you can simply add them. Otherwise you have to do matrix multiplication


I'm sure there is online calculators for that. Basically you want to do forward kinematics


You can also see the translation and rotation of a node relative to others in webots

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 11:55:08
Yeah, i have the transform on matlab. But i was trying to dynamically generate the manipulator, for given vector of design parameters, without having to manually input the transforms


Thank you

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:07:31
You may be able to simply chain them. I don't know if it works or not

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:14:26
Its a chain of 3 transform with both rotation and translation. I could indeed multiply the matrices to obtain the equivalent transform, and then extract the translation and rotation, but i was wondering if there was a tool, in the PROTO, to automatically compute the chain of transforms. Or if there was a way to allow the chain to be interpreted as one transform in the bounding object

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:15:19
try it out

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:16:25
I tried tried to chain them, but webots says it only allows a transform with a shape/geometry child, not a chain of transforms with a shape/geometry child:

"A Transform node inside a 'boundingObject' can only contain one Shape or one Geometry node. The child node is ignored.!"

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:21:20
I think the structure of the proto you want is something like this:

```
Robot {
  Solid {
    translation ...
    rotation ....
    boundingObject Transform {
      translation ...
      rotation ...
      children [
        Box {
           size ...
        }
      ]
    ...
    }
    children [
      Solid {
      next link in the kinematic chain
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


the transform of the bounding object is relative to the solid

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:30:35
Exactly, my problem is that, given the kinematics, i have to describe the bounding object with a chain of Transforms, like:

```
Robot {
  Solid {
    translation ...
    rotation ....
    boundingObject Transform {
      translation ...
      rotation ...
      children [
        Transform {
          translation ...
          rotation ...
          children [
            Transform {
              translation ...
              rotation ...
              children [
                Box {
                 size ...
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    ...
    }
    children [
      Solid {
      next link in the kinematic chain
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


And he doesn't allow this chain of transforms

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:32:34
how are your solids connected?

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:33:58
with ball and hingejoints


When i try to chain transform it says:

 A Transform node inside a 'boundingObject' can only contain one Shape or one Geometry node. The child node is ignored.

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:34:23
but there are multiple bounding boxes in each link?

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:35:11
No, each link only has one bounding object

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:36:02
then the bounding box for each link should be inside that link (or solid how it is called in webots)


otherwise they will not move if the robot's joints move

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:38:36
So the bounding shape must be a child of the solid and called to be used in the bounding object?

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:40:25
i am not quite sure what you mean by "called to be used in the bounding object"


but yes the bounding object should be a child of the solid

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:41:11
A solid node has the field BoundingObject, that's where you add the collision geometry

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:41:40
the visual shape you add in the children field

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:41:48
Sorry for the horrible indentation


But it doesn't allow me, because the MOBILE\_PLATFORM\_SHAPE has a chain of Transforms. If it was only one transform it would work

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:43:22
the Shape has to have the DEF

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:44:53
Yeah, but if i do that the boundingObject will be in the wrong place, because it loses the transforms


I could start with the chain of transforms, and define the solid has a child of it. But this is a end-effector of a joint and it only allows the end-effector to be a solid

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 12:46:37
why do you need that chain of transforms anyways?

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:50:49
Basically i'm trying to describe where the blue platform is in space. And i don't know where it is relative to the green joint, but i do know where it is relative to the red plate.



So i'm transforming the coordinate system from the green joint referential into the red plate referential.

I could know where the blue plate is relative to the green joint, but the direct kinematics are fairly complicated and i was trying to avoid that path

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:52:55
you should start by defining your kinematic chain as solid->joint->....->solid

where the solid after a joint is in the endPoint field of the joint and a joint after a solid is a child to the solid

you also put in the translations and rotations between the solids in the translation and rotation field of the joint, make sure to also set the joint parameters of the joint correctly

then you can put the bounding objects into the solids where the transform you set it to is relative to the solid it belongs to

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 12:58:57
Thank you. I'm doing that, i started by following the Stewart platform example

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 12:59:03
the pose of the blue table is based on the pose of green rods, therefore it has to be defined relative to the green rods

##### Cyber Police Officer 01/26/2021 13:00:05
Yes, the problem is that implies solving the direct kinematics, which are nontrivial in parallel manipulators


For instance, in that manipulator it implies solving a system of 6 nonlinear equations


Thank you for the help!

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/26/2021 13:09:24
yes you are right, it's really a lot more difficult for parallel manipulators..

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 15:21:46
of course, just add a new object and load in your model for the visual shape and Bounding object

##### alejanpa17 01/26/2021 15:28:13
the problem is that my model has too many faces so the sim is giving me "Your world may be too complex."

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 15:29:10
you should approximate the bounding object with simple geometries


you can also specify the inertia matrix yourself.

##### jejay 01/26/2021 15:47:32
Hey guys I have a few questions: There is a kinematic mode mentioned (no physics, just animations) in the docs but it is not clear to me how to use it. Can I import animated objects (e.g. a car+trajectory animation) that I exported from blender? is there curves, interpolation etc?


and the other question extends this: is there a way to import humans + skeletal animation, again in kinematics mode?

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 15:51:46
The `TrafficCone.proto` has a `physics` field which is set to `NULL`. Simply adding a `Physics` node in there should add physics to it.


The `boundingObject` of the `TrafficCone.proto` is approximated with a `Box` and 3 `Capsule` primitives.


Simply removing the `Physics` nodes will disable physics in the simulation. Then, you will be able to animate the model from a supervisor controller by changing the `translation` and `rotation` fields of the objects you want to move.


As for human, see `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/humans/pedestrian` for some simple robotic human models.


Webots also support skeletal animation, see `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/rendering/worlds/animated_skin.wbt`. However we do not distribute human model with skeletal animation, but it was tested and works.

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:00:08
interesting, thanks!


so there is no simple way to play back a prerecorded animation or one that has been included e.g. in a collada file other than implementing it on your own step by step?

##### alejanpa17 01/26/2021 16:05:41

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:06:30
the motion functions ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions)) are for physics/actuators only? I dont understand how you record them and where the motion editor is that is mentioned in the docs

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/26/2021 16:09:39
The motion editor doesn't exist any more. The motion functions work for both physics and non-physics actuators.


We have some skin animation code in the works: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-doc/pull/96](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots-doc/pull/96) but it didn't yet reached the release.


The motion editor is actually deprecated and provided only for the Robotis-OP2 robot: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#motion-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#motion-editor)


But you can create a motion file from a simple text editor (the format is human readable).

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 16:15:27
you can also make a simple controller and use a supervisor to set jointagnles or right out the position and orientation of solids


and just read your trajectory or whatever you have and execute it in a loop

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:16:02

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:37:17
ah maybe actually one final thing. If I stay in physics mode and take for example the bmw scene. Now I turn on manual mode and drive around. Can I record this into a motion file to replay the physics control in a later simulation? or would I need to write a controller that records my actions and then write those into a motion file (which in then could also be my own file format)?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 16:38:12
you can record and replay anything you want. You could log the position of the whole model for example, and the then just replay that


with a supervisor you can set anything really

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:38:46
yeah but i need to code that supervisor, right

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 16:39:04
very simple

##### jejay 01/26/2021 16:39:07

yeah makes sense


yeah I see that this is simple 🙂

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/26/2021 16:39:34
you get a handle to the node or field you want to change, and change it


instead of motors, you can directly change the joints

Hello `@chungshan`, the Motor node returns a force feedback as well:

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/27/2021 10:03:31
`@chungshan` What exactly do you mean by the force in the joint? A joint can only have a torque. Only linear actuators can have forces. Perhaps you can clarify 🙂

Does anyone have experience creating an overhead map with a camera? And potentially stitching multiple images together to create an encompassing overhead map?

##### Laojiang 01/28/2021 06:35:05
How can I make a object whose the shape is a bowl?

##### Darko Lukić [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/28/2021 07:53:16
In Webots? You can add a camera to a Supervisor robot or drone and take the images. Then, add the images to a software such as Pix4d (but probably there is a free alternative) to create a map.

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/28/2021 08:42:52
you can create a 3d model (many formats such as .stl, .obj, .dae and .blend are supported)


an example how to create a bowl model in open scad can be found here: [http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/OpenScad\_beginners\_tutorial#Simple\_CSG\_examples](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/OpenScad_beginners_tutorial#Simple_CSG_examples)


then export it as stl (file->export) in open scad and import it in webots (file->import 3D model)

##### yash 01/29/2021 10:05:23
Sorry for the message before. Please ignore it.      I would like to know that if we have a structure like this -

          While robot.step(timestep)!=1

                    if (condition)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     for i in ----

   In this case when the execution is in the for loop will the robot.step(timestep) be updated ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/29/2021 10:06:37
no, only when the robot.step() is executed, which is every iteration of the while loop

##### JSK 01/29/2021 10:06:50
Nop.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/29/2021 10:06:56
you could add an extra robot.step() inside the for loop

Hi everyone, I recently downloaded Webots and when I went to make my own world, it comes up with an error saying that it can't find 'wbmath' and when I look at the file directory the files aren't there in any capacity - does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve that issue, would it just be a matter of reinstalling the program?

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/29/2021 10:45:11
how did you install webots?

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:45:58
Via the cyberotics website using the newest Windows version it had available

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/29/2021 10:47:30
I'm sorry I don't know much about windows, maybe someone else can help with that.

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:48:04
That's fine, thank you for trying anyways 🙂

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/29/2021 10:48:59
Can you run the other demos of Webots (e.g., guided tour) without any problem?

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:49:43
I opened the introductory demos, all of them I believe, with no issues at all

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/29/2021 10:50:48
So what is particular with your world file? Did you add any specific object?

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 10:52:10
I created a new project Directory via the wizard and ticked all the boxes when given the option but then the 'rectangle arena' caused an error but the rest of the world loaded successfully


I added a model of BB-8 after I created the world and the floor didn't work

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 01/29/2021 11:33:29
I tried, but cannot reproduce this problem (tested on Windows 10).

##### Lynerea 01/29/2021 11:34:53
I don't understand how, after no tampering on my part, that the file was deleted, I don't know how it happened and I doubt I could reproduce the issue but reinstalling the program seems to have solved the issue for now

##### smasud98 01/30/2021 05:29:13
Hi everyone! I am new to webots and not sure if this is the right place to be asking this question. I am considering getting the Macbook with the M1 chip which uses ARM. I was wondering if anyone knows whether Webots will work well with this. Thanks

##### Krish 01/30/2021 06:03:49
Wait for this year's lineup.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 14:23:48
`@smasud98` This is generally the right place to ask any questions regarding Webots. I think you should be fine with the macbook. While Webots is an x86 program, Apple's Rosetta 2 - x86 emulation seems to be very good and powerful. In general you should ask yourself the question though, whether a macbook is the right tool. If you want to dive deep into programming and development, engineering applications and linux, then it might be more advisable to get an x86 machine.  Perhaps you can tell me what you want to use your laptop for in general. Whether you are willing to switch to linux and/or linux is another big factor.

##### Krish 01/30/2021 15:24:37
Yeah well said.

He told me that he is more interested in getting a Mac than a Linux machine, he says that he has the 2015 Macbook and webots runs very slowly in that.

Also, not all the apps and programming languages are configured to run on the M1.



So he says if Webots does not run on it, he will just return and take the refund back.

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 15:39:30
The new macbook is a completely new hardware & software product. It probably works really well for a pure consumer, but as soon as you start development and go outside of MacOS, I foresee a lot of issues. Linux can run on arm, but by far not all software and programs.  I have a Lenovo Legion laptop. It is basically a gamer laptop, that looks more professional. I bought it for robotic simulation and Reinforcement Learning. I dont see macbooks being a good choice for that. For AI you kinda need a Nvidia GPU, and a powerful x86 CPU is a godsent when compiling and running lots of parallelized code / many instances.

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 15:46:55
Hi everyone, i'm having an issue with a basic HingeJoint for a wheel


I have a differential robot, and when it's turning in place, le wheels are "moving sideways"


like on a bad bike


By looking at the tree I see small  values in the `translation` field of the wheel although the joint is configured to only allow rotation on an axis

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 15:51:18
can you share your world or a screenshot of your hingjoint? with JointParameters expanded in the scene tree

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 15:58:32
it is always good practice to have the same anchor as translation of the endPoint solid.  currently it rotates around the y-axis of in the 2nd image


move the anchor to where you want the center of rotation to be

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 15:59:18
Oh, ok


On top of my Hinge I have a Transform


I can remove the Transform, and instead use anchor & translation on the endpoint solid right ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:00:19
the transform is fine.


send me your world, i can have a quick look


the issue is, if you have a translation of the endpoint, which is NOT along the rotational axis

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 16:07:04
The translation of the enpoint was the result of the bug, I did not manually edit these  values



%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/805106901393604679/unknown.png)
%end


I just tried this, deleting the Transform above the Joint, no success

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:08:58
the translation of the endPoint changes with when the joint rotates. So at the start, the anchor and translation have to be the same (assuming you want the endPoint to rotate around its origin)

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 16:09:47
which is the case on my last screenshot right ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:09:56

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:10:47
this should work too

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 16:10:53
Which is also the case when the transform is done above; I have the same endpoint translation and anchor


Still have the problem though 😄

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:11:06
what problem?

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 16:11:50
When the robot is turning in place, the wheels are slightly translating


instead of only rotating around the joint axis

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 01/30/2021 16:12:54
I would have to see the whole thing. But just stick with the solution that works


that is the 'proper' way to do it

##### PymZoR [Premier Service] 01/30/2021 16:13:06
No solution works atm haha

##### babaev1 01/31/2021 20:20:54
Hello, can’t figure out why two solids pass through each other like non-material objects during simulation running. Bounding objects are defined and physics is added for both solids. Could it be due to that dencity is -1, but mass has positive value? Could it be due to that inertia matrix is not added? Could it be due to that center of mass is not added for solids?

##### paperwave 01/31/2021 22:33:56
`@babaev1` When you click on the boundingObject node you should see the bounding region surrounding the Solid, if you don't see it, it may be covered from your graphical view.

##### babaev1 01/31/2021 22:35:44
Bounding region covers solid and I can see it

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/31/2021 22:37:09
the density field is used to calculate the mass by using the volume of the bounding object, if a mass is specified it should be -1


are the two solids that should collide part of the same proto?

##### babaev1 01/31/2021 22:38:07
Solids are designed by myself from primitives

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/31/2021 22:39:22
what i am trying to ask is if the two solids are defined in the same file?

##### babaev1 01/31/2021 22:39:41
Yes

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/31/2021 22:40:09
in the robot node, there is a parameter selfCollision, you might need to enable that

I see, it doesn't have that because it was a base node.


looking for the wbt file, maybe that'll do it


It's my second day of webots so I know it's something simple

##### Bitbots\_Jasper 01/31/2021 23:10:47
The problem is that it is probably save in a location where you can not edit it (because you need sudo or admin). Copy the proto file from your webots installation to your own proto folder


maybe this helps to understand how you should structure your webots projects: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)

##### paperwave 01/31/2021 23:13:19
moving the protos folder now


Looks like this part of the tutorial only uses base nodes so there was no proto on it however, I restarted Webots and was able to rename the wheels which is great. Fixing something else I messed up present, thanks for the help

There is a dedicated window to edit the field, but it seems that you hide it.

It is located just below this scene tree.

So to show you can click on the sidget separator (indicated by the three lines on the bottom of your screenshot) and drag it up, or restore the default application layout from the `Tools > Restore Layout`

    print(i, '  -  ', device.getName(), '   - Model:', device.getModel(),'   - NodeType:', device.getNodeType())

    # if device is a rotational motor (uncomment line above to get a list of all robot devices)

    if device.getNodeType() == 54:  

        motors.append(device)

        minPositions.append(device.getMinPosition())

        except Exception as e:

            print('Rotational Motor: ' + device.getName() + ' has no Position Sensor')


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

this is an example, how I initialize robotic arms. It automatically creates a list of all rotational motors, their position sensors and the corresponting min and max positions

##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 02/01/2021 15:39:16
You are right, there is no such sensor. But basically, this can be implemented at the controller level from a standard camera flow, not inside Webots.

##### PRVG 02/01/2021 15:41:49

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 16:39:29
I'm trying to make k-team's hemisson robot rotate around itself using the setPosition command in Python (with getTargetPosition +/- rotate\_value). However whether I try to increase the position or decrease it the robot always moves forward


I'm also facing an issue with its pen node which simply doesn't work at times. I've made a few tests starting it from random positions and it might work or it might not work. At times when it is not working, if I start manually  moving the robot around while the simulation is running it might write a bit and then stop or it might start writing normally

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 02/01/2021 18:34:50
the setPosition most likely changes the wheel angle, not the robot rotation. So to rotate, you have to turn one clockwise and the other ccw

That is what I am doing. I use the motor.getTargetPosition() to get the position at that specific moment and then increase one wheel / decrease the other to make it turn. I've already used this code on a robot I made and it has been working without issues


I've performed the following simple test. Set both wheel positions at 100 and run it. The robot moves forward. Reset and set both wheel positions at -100. Robot moves forward again, even though it should be moving backwards

for wheels you should probably use velocity control


and change the angles incrementally. Also remember, that the values are radian


so 100 is a lot

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 18:56:41
I've been trying to make the robot turn exactly 90 degrees (and then other angles) which is why I have been using position instead. I am aware values are radian,  the 100 is just an example to show it is not working as it should


Weirdly enough, if I do use setVelocity with +/- on the wheels it does work as it should. I really don't want to have to re-work my code though. The setPosition should be working as well which is what I am trying to solve

Hi everyone, I was wondering if someone tried to use asyncio for a python controller ?

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 02/01/2021 20:02:38
if your starting position is -200, then it will drive forward in both cases, setting the target to -100 and 100

##### Chernayaten 02/01/2021 20:38:15
That's why I said in my first message that I use the .getTargetPosition() method. The increase/decrease is always done in regards to the wheel position at that moment. That means that if my starting position was -200 then one wheel would increase to -100 and the other would decrease to -300

##### Simon Steinmann [ROS 2 Meeting-Moderator] 02/02/2021 10:57:01
`@Chernayaten`  Why are you using .getTargetPosition() instead of using the position sensor to get the current position?


positionSensor = motor.getPositionSensor()

positionSensor.enable(timestep)

pos = positionSensor.getValue()


I suspect that the issue lies here


.getTargetPosition()  gives you the last command issued with setPosition() and NOT the current position

##### Chernayaten 02/02/2021 13:12:48
I am doing it this way because I do not care about the current position of the motor. My code is working correctly in my own robot, it works correctly on a different robot I randomly picked (Lego's Mindstorms), but it doesn't work correctly on the Hemisson robot.


while self.step(self.TIME\_STEP) != -1:

    left.setPosition(left.getTargetPosition() - 10)

    right.setPosition(right.getTargetPosition() + 10)


Regardless of whether this is the smart way to do it, the following code should make the robot constantly rotate around itself. Hemisson robot doesn't do that and I can't figure out why. At the same time the other two robots I mentioned do

Hello everyone

dose anyone knows how can I train robot using pytorch in webots?

use an extern python controller

##### John520 02/02/2021 20:25:42
Hi, I'd like to create a crop field for lidar detection simulation. I found out that Webots provides Trees and Plants objects. My questions are: 1. Can the tree and plant objects (shape and leaves) be detected by a lidar in the simulation? 2. Is there a way to create a crop object by myself? Thank you!

##### LucasW 02/03/2021 00:55:54
Hi all, I'm a student working on a project using Webots for the first time. This is a pretty basic question but I'm implementing an approximation of the VL53L1X tof sensor see [https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html#overview](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html#overview) for details, or [https://www.pololu.com/product/3415/specs](https://www.pololu.com/product/3415/specs) for a quick specs overview. I was wondering what units resolution is measured in/should I just make it infinite and I don't understand what response values I should map the distances too? Any help would be appreciated thanks.
