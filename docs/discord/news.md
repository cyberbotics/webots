Hi! I want to share the result obtained by my students. During the lab classes, the Visual Tracking problem was solved from robotbenchmark.net. The solution to the problem is based on a simplified Kalman filter, translation of the image into the HSV space and more precise control over the motor. Performance of proposed solution - 77.94% (ranking # 2/67). Author of the solution - Abrosimov Kirill. [https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL)

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:21:07
`@AngelAyala` If you want to make the drone move, you can change the target position using keyboard input. The default target position is x=0, y=0

##### AngelAyala 05/27/2020 00:11:30
`@Alfian` thats ok, I used his algorithm as base for controlling the drone with PID, but if is improved, can't take all the credits, its just that. How you control the drone, you pass the X and Y position where must be? I'm trying to controlling manipulating the angles with a keyboard input.

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:07:15
`@AngelAyala` When I try the file is not working correctly. So I fix it. Thus, anyone can run the simulation correctly. Okay, I will reference it. Thank you.
