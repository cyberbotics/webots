##### Olivier Michel [ROS 2 Meeting-Cyberbotics] 02/02/2021 11:27:13
Here is sneak preview of our brand new 3D web interface for Webots:  [https://cyberbotics.com/animations/nao\_room/nao\_room.html](https://cyberbotics.com/animations/nao_room/nao_room.html) 

It is based on a port of WREN (Webots Rendering ENgine) to webassembly and thus the rendering on the web page is very similar to the one you get in Webots. Moreover, it is fully compatible with the previous Webots animation format, so you can create a Webots animation (or re-use an existing one) and publish it on the web using this new 3D viewer.

Hi! I want to share the result obtained by my students. During the lab classes, the Visual Tracking problem was solved from robotbenchmark.net. The solution to the problem is based on a simplified Kalman filter, translation of the image into the HSV space and more precise control over the motor. Performance of proposed solution - 77.94% (ranking # 2/67). Author of the solution - Abrosimov Kirill. [https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL)

`@AngelAyala` If you want to make the drone move, you can change the target position using keyboard input. The default target position is x=0, y=0

##### AngelAyala 05/27/2020 00:11:30
`@Alfian` thats ok, I used his algorithm as base for controlling the drone with PID, but if is improved, can't take all the credits, its just that. How you control the drone, you pass the X and Y position where must be? I'm trying to controlling manipulating the angles with a keyboard input.

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:07:15
`@AngelAyala` When I try the file is not working correctly. So I fix it. Thus, anyone can run the simulation correctly. Okay, I will reference it. Thank you.

`@Alfian` the code is yours? it looks like was previously implemented here, [https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL](https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL) I think you must at least reference the work

##### machinekoder 12/20/2019 10:41:23
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Is RWebots 2020a also released for Ubuntu Melodic or do we have to wait for the next and last ROS classic release with Py3 support?

The webots\_ros package lets you use Webots together with ROS.



This new version of the package greatly simplifies the interface between Webots and ROS, new launch files are provided to start your node and the corresponding simulation easily. We also wrote some documentation about the available sample simulations: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations)
