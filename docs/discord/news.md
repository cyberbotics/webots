Webots just got awarded as the 2022 best ROS software: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-construct\_rosawards-ros-software-activity-6943964072845484033-TIom?utm\_source=linkedin\_share&utm\_medium=android\_app](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-construct_rosawards-ros-software-activity-6943964072845484033-TIom?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=android_app)


**Call for beta-testers**

A brand new Python API has been developed by `@Justin Fisher` recently. This new API is more "pythonic" and should be easier and more powerful to use than the current one. Moreover, it should work better with different versions and flavors of Python. Anyone out there is welcome to test it and report any issue or comment on the github repository of the project. It can be tested with the most recent version of Webots (e.g., R2022a): [https://github.com/Justin-Fisher/new\_python\_api\_for\_webots](https://github.com/Justin-Fisher/new_python_api_for_webots)


If you like Webots, you can voice it here: [https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros-awards-2022/](https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros-awards-2022/)


Apple Silicon beta testers wanted: if you are a lucky owner of a M1 Apple computer, we would grateful if you could test our latest nightly build of Webots R2022b which includes native support for M1 architecture. The first version is available here: [[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)/download/nightly\_31\_5\_2022/webots-R2022b.dmg]([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)/download/nightly_31_5_2022/webots-R2022b.dmg).

**Cyberbotics helped to deploy ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi Pico**



Ubuntu has recently published a very nice article about deploying ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi Pico. The article is based on an example that Cyberbotics contributed.  It shows Cyberbotic's initiative to contribute to ROS 2 in aspects other than simulation.

**Tesla Model 3 simulation in Webots: The first step towards ROS 2 automobile integration **

It is now official: Webots will be used as the simulation platform of the upcoming Robocup Virtual Humanoid Soccer Competition: [https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-2021/call-for-participation/](https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-2021/call-for-participation/)


Here is sneak preview of our brand new 3D web interface for Webots:  [https://cyberbotics.com/animations/nao\_room/nao\_room.html](https://cyberbotics.com/animations/nao_room/nao_room.html) 

It is based on a port of WREN (Webots Rendering ENgine) to webassembly and thus the rendering on the web page is very similar to the one you get in Webots. Moreover, it is fully compatible with the previous Webots animation format, so you can create a Webots animation (or re-use an existing one) and publish it on the web using this new 3D viewer.

Hi! I want to share the result obtained by my students. During the lab classes, the Visual Tracking problem was solved from robotbenchmark.net. The solution to the problem is based on a simplified Kalman filter, translation of the image into the HSV space and more precise control over the motor. Performance of proposed solution - 77.94% (ranking # 2/67). Author of the solution - Abrosimov Kirill. [https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL)

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:21:07
`@AngelAyala` If you want to make the drone move, you can change the target position using keyboard input. The default target position is x=0, y=0

##### AngelAyala 05/27/2020 00:11:30
`@Alfian` thats ok, I used his algorithm as base for controlling the drone with PID, but if is improved, can't take all the credits, its just that. How you control the drone, you pass the X and Y position where must be? I'm trying to controlling manipulating the angles with a keyboard input.

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:07:15
`@AngelAyala` When I try the file is not working correctly. So I fix it. Thus, anyone can run the simulation correctly. Okay, I will reference it. Thank you.
