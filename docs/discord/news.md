Cyberbotics started to work on the OPTIMA EU\_H2020/EuroHPC\_JU project together with a consortium of industrial and academic partners including T.S.I, Fraunhofer ITWM, Exapsys, ICCS, M3E, MaxelerTech, FZ Juelich, EnginSoft and Appentra. The project aims at the optimization of industrial applications for heterogeneous HPC systems. More information is available from the project website: [https://optima-hpc.eu](https://optima-hpc.eu)


Webots appears in a pretty good position in this open source robotics simulation page: [https://www.libhunt.com/t/robotics-simulation](https://www.libhunt.com/t/robotics-simulation)


Here is a nice master thesis report making extensive use of Webots: [https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/17504/1/tesi.pdf](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/17504/1/tesi.pdf)

Hello everyone,



I created youtube list for you.

This list is about with Fusion360 and Webots.

**Cyberbotics helped to deploy ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi Pico**



Ubuntu has recently published a very nice article about deploying ROS 2 on Raspberry Pi Pico. The article is based on an example that Cyberbotics contributed.  It shows Cyberbotic's initiative to contribute to ROS 2 in aspects other than simulation.

**Tesla Model 3 simulation in Webots: The first step towards ROS 2 automobile integration **



More about this is available:

It is now official: Webots will be used as the simulation platform of the upcoming Robocup Virtual Humanoid Soccer Competition: [https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-2021/call-for-participation/](https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-2021/call-for-participation/)


Here is sneak preview of our brand new 3D web interface for Webots:  [https://cyberbotics.com/animations/nao\_room/nao\_room.html](https://cyberbotics.com/animations/nao_room/nao_room.html) 

It is based on a port of WREN (Webots Rendering ENgine) to webassembly and thus the rendering on the web page is very similar to the one you get in Webots. Moreover, it is fully compatible with the previous Webots animation format, so you can create a Webots animation (or re-use an existing one) and publish it on the web using this new 3D viewer.

Hi! I want to share the result obtained by my students. During the lab classes, the Visual Tracking problem was solved from robotbenchmark.net. The solution to the problem is based on a simplified Kalman filter, translation of the image into the HSV space and more precise control over the motor. Performance of proposed solution - 77.94% (ranking # 2/67). Author of the solution - Abrosimov Kirill. [https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyZ8Zrq5aL)

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:21:07
`@AngelAyala` If you want to make the drone move, you can change the target position using keyboard input. The default target position is x=0, y=0

##### AngelAyala 05/27/2020 00:11:30
`@Alfian` thats ok, I used his algorithm as base for controlling the drone with PID, but if is improved, can't take all the credits, its just that. How you control the drone, you pass the X and Y position where must be? I'm trying to controlling manipulating the angles with a keyboard input.

##### Alfian 05/27/2020 00:07:15
`@AngelAyala` When I try the file is not working correctly. So I fix it. Thus, anyone can run the simulation correctly. Okay, I will reference it. Thank you.

`@Alfian` the code is yours? it looks like was previously implemented here, [https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL](https://github.com/PrasadNR/Webots-Quadcopter-Python-SITL) I think you must at least reference the work

New release of the webots\_ros package: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros)



The webots\_ros package lets you use Webots together with ROS.



This new version of the package greatly simplifies the interface between Webots and ROS, new launch files are provided to start your node and the corresponding simulation easily. We also wrote some documentation about the available sample simulations: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations)
