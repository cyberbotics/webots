Goodnight!



Does anyone know any way to stop the Webots simulation by code?

Thank you so much!

Hello, is there a 2 finger gripper compatible with webots simulation UR5 available to download ? I can't use the 3 finger one for my project.

okay so the webots update definitely broke some things


this is now how the world loads, which has been created in 2021

the IK solvers for pyikfast are also broken


[https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots\_pyikfast\_tutorial](https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots_pyikfast_tutorial) this worked in 2021b


Did the robot models change?

Is this the ABB IRB 4600? The coordenate system changed.

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/18/2022 00:24:30
it is


well I guess I will have to recompile the solvers ðŸ˜©

hmm the irb seems to work, but I still have weird issues... not sure I wanna dive super deep in right now


I think I found the solution. Now I am working on a Inverse Kinematics repository, including all 6DOF arms in webots and providing solvers for each, thus only requiring a simple `pip install .` to install the solver for a particular robot

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/18/2022 10:06:53
Yes, the robot models were also changed to respect the ENU/FLU standards and be more compliant with ROS and other robotics frameworks. See details here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/How-to-adapt-your-world-or-PROTO-to-Webots-R2022a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/How-to-adapt-your-world-or-PROTO-to-Webots-R2022a)

Hi, I wanna gauge your interest and opinion. Through interest form `@shpigi` I have gotten back into the whole inverse kinematics and working on my sample project and pyikfast (cyberbotics repository). I created a lot of solvers in the past (all 6DOF arms at the time). I think it would be very beneficial for Webots, if those solvers and a simple controler + install instructions (pip install .) could be provided officially in webots. Setting these things up and getting it to work is a major pain in the behind. Especially for newcomers.


Currently I have a somewhat complexer controller, providing an algorithm to pick the best solution out of all possible solutions provided by ikfast (This is actually a big deal and makes it work much better than any other ik solution I tried). I also added cartesian velocity control.


I think it would make sense to put those 2 features into the c++ portion. Making it much simpler to use for the user. (and faster)

##### [Red Dragons] Mat198 01/19/2022 00:33:56
I'm feeling that pain right now...

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/19/2022 00:34:22
feel free to pm me, if you want help right now
