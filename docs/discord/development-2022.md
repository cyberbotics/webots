Goodnight!



Does anyone know any way to stop the Webots simulation by code?

Thank you so much!

Hello, is there a 2 finger gripper compatible with webots simulation UR5 available to download ? I can't use the 3 finger one for my project.

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/18/2022 00:16:40
okay so the webots update definitely broke some things


this is now how the world loads, which has been created in 2021

the IK solvers for pyikfast are also broken


[https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots\_pyikfast\_tutorial](https://github.com/Simon-Steinmann/webots_pyikfast_tutorial) this worked in 2021b


Did the robot models change?

##### [Red Dragons] Mat198 01/18/2022 00:24:18
Is this the ABB IRB 4600? The coordenate system changed.

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/18/2022 00:24:30
it is


well I guess I will have to recompile the solvers ðŸ˜©

hmm the irb seems to work, but I still have weird issues... not sure I wanna dive super deep in right now


I think I found the solution. Now I am working on a Inverse Kinematics repository, including all 6DOF arms in webots and providing solvers for each, thus only requiring a simple `pip install .` to install the solver for a particular robot

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/18/2022 10:06:53
Yes, the robot models were also changed to respect the ENU/FLU standards and be more compliant with ROS and other robotics frameworks. See details here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/How-to-adapt-your-world-or-PROTO-to-Webots-R2022a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/How-to-adapt-your-world-or-PROTO-to-Webots-R2022a)

Hi, I wanna gauge your interest and opinion. Through interest form `@shpigi` I have gotten back into the whole inverse kinematics and working on my sample project and pyikfast (cyberbotics repository). I created a lot of solvers in the past (all 6DOF arms at the time). I think it would be very beneficial for Webots, if those solvers and a simple controler + install instructions (pip install .) could be provided officially in webots. Setting these things up and getting it to work is a major pain in the behind. Especially for newcomers.


Currently I have a somewhat complexer controller, providing an algorithm to pick the best solution out of all possible solutions provided by ikfast (This is actually a big deal and makes it work much better than any other ik solution I tried). I also added cartesian velocity control.


I think it would make sense to put those 2 features into the c++ portion. Making it much simpler to use for the user. (and faster)

##### [Red Dragons] Mat198 01/19/2022 00:33:56
I'm feeling that pain right now...

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/19/2022 00:34:22
feel free to pm me, if you want help right now

##### JosÃ©eMallah 01/20/2022 13:46:41
Hello everyone!

I am looking to modeling the human gait cycle so to represent the human body and make it walk.

I got the c3d body representation proto, and I was wondering how to actually control the body and make it walk. I am new to webots, and thought that a supervisor might be able to actuate the joints and simulate walking.

Is there any better way to do so - like to control the body itself without using a supervisor? And is the c3d model good for biomechanical simulations?

Thank you

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 01/21/2022 02:10:26
you have to add motors to the joints

##### the-french-bunny 01/21/2022 06:48:51
hello well met everyone first of all i LOVE the concept of this software a great place to prototype and test robot designs and concepts before attempting production FANTASTIC for both hobbyists, newbies(like myself) and professionals. however as a newbie im having some trouble understanding the design proccess for the robots themselves as i kinda want to design a robot from scratch based on the design of cubli.

##### amna 01/28/2022 08:09:16
What values shall i give to trajectory, speed and step in human.py?

## February

##### Luftwaffel [Moderator] 02/22/2022 17:25:36
This reply might be a bit late, but if you still want help, could you clarify your question a bit? Do you have troubles with how to add nodes together in Webots? Or is the issue  unrelated to software and more on general design of a robot?


<@&568329906048598039> the void controller seems to be broken in the latest nightly build (21/2/2022). On ubuntu 20.04 installed with tarball.  this test world just has unmodified ur3e with void controller and it crashes. EDIT: ENV variable was set incorrectly, sorry for the confusion
