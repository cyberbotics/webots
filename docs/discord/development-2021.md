The conversation in technical-questions made me think: Wouldn't it be a nice feature, to have an 'odometry' device? Which retrieves the pose of it's parent. Of course this can be done manually with a supervisor, however that is more complicated for beginners and well, requires a supervisor.

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/05/2021 09:47:22
Yes, but I believe that such an odometry device doesn't exists in real life...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 09:56:13
no it doesnt, but it can be a good first step / validation tool. This is used all the time in ROS and Gazebo


It could be implemented in the Robot node perhaps. "getPosition", "getOrientation"

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/05/2021 10:01:28
It is already there when you turn your robot into a supervisor.

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/05/2021 10:10:39
well I guess that's true. Still could be useful to have a device one could add to Solids/Transforms, in order to retrieve the pose


Found a strange behavior, exporting a robot as URDF uses the boundingObject as the visual geometry, not the shape. Is this on purpose? Or simply because mesh extraction is not implemented yet?

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 08:00:15
Yes, it is described in the note under `wb_robot_get_urdf` documentation. We have a basic implementation of URDF exporter that can work for most use-cases (publish ROS transforms, calculate inverse kinematics, and similar), but only a basic visualization is possible.

`@Darko Lukiƒá` launching the dynamic rviz with ros2, this Error comes up

this is part of the console output

I suspect that the reason is rviz launching before webots and ros2 is fully loaded


loading the same config again once it is running, no errors come up

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:04:06
RViz2 is a bit buggy, just uncheck/check the RobotModel checkbox and it should work

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:04:29
you're right


is there a quick and easy way to include the world frame in the tf broadcast?

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:06:26
You can add a static transform publisher to your launch file:

```py
static_tf = Node(
  package='tf2_ros',
  executable='static_transform_publisher',
  name='static_transform_publisher',
  output='log',
  arguments=['0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 'world', 'base_link']
)
```

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:07:00
what if the robot is mobile?

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:07:48
Than you have to publish the transforms manually :/

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:09:00
does that work alongside the robot\_state\_publisher?

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:10:07
Sure

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:10:37
maybe that should be a feature of the webots\_ros2\_core

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:11:42
We do it here for example:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/7aa84877e0dc5d668e923fd2f23ebd4acb865d90/webots\_ros2\_examples/webots\_ros2\_examples/khepera\_driver.py#L92-L105](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/7aa84877e0dc5d668e923fd2f23ebd4acb865d90/webots_ros2_examples/webots_ros2_examples/khepera_driver.py#L92-L105)


The robot state publisher is in the core, what would you like to add in addition to it?

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:13:18
have an option (or by default) to pulbish the world - baselink transform


static robots are one thing, but especially for mobile ones, it is kinda essential.

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:14:52
But that is something that a user has to handle

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:15:37
Gazebo publishes it by default, people are used to simply selecting "world" in rviz

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:17:16
Gazebo publishes transform between `world` and `base_link` for mobile robots? That sounds like cheating


In the real-world transform between `world` and `base_link` is not available

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:18:02
maybe it is just static. Has been a while, dont remember

##### Darko Lukiƒá [Cyberbotics] 01/07/2021 10:18:31
We can easily add it using Supervisor, but it is strange to have something like that

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/07/2021 10:20:13
hmmm where exactly would I add that tf\_static node?


for example when using this: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2/blob/master/webots\_ros2\_universal\_robot/launch/universal\_robot\_rviz\_dynamic.launch.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/blob/master/webots_ros2_universal_robot/launch/universal_robot_rviz_dynamic.launch.py)


line 43?


jup, works üôÇ

##### Moha 01/13/2021 07:53:46
hi guys

is it possible to use "vscode" as my IDE?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 07:55:10
Sure.

üëç

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/13/2021 08:44:39
I'm curious, wouldn't it be possible to set system environment variables during installation?


`@Darko Lukiƒá` `@Olivier Michel` I've got moveit2 working with ros2 and webots. I also made some progress of creating an easy to use template or automatic setup for robotic arms


I think one important feature would be, to automatically extract the urdf from webots, including meshes.


I already did some work in that direction with my proto-splitter script. That one worked, extracting .obj or vrml meshes, but without smoothing

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 09:42:21
Probably yes on Windows, probably not possible on Mac and Linux...

##### Simon Steinmann [Moderator] 01/13/2021 09:44:28
ahh okay


Also I was wondering: could it be possible to launch a ROS1 or ROS2 launch file from within webots?

##### Olivier Michel [Cyberbotics] 01/13/2021 11:23:51
I am not sure this is a good idea as we want to be able to interact with ROS in the console...
