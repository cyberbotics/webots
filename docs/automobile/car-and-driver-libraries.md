# Car and Driver Libraries

To ease the creation of controllers for any `Car` PROTO models (or any PROTO node inherited from `Car`), two libraries are provided.
These two libraries are easy to use, provide high-level functionalities and save the user from knowing the name of the internal devices nodes ([Motors](../reference/motor.md), [Brakes](../reference/brake.md), etc.) of the car.
This section presents and explains how to use these two libraries.
