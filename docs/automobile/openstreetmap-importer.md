# OpenStreetMap Importer

In order to ease the creation of new environments for automobile simulations, Webots worlds can be generated from OpenStreetMap maps using the importer script described here.

You can download an OpenStreetMap map of any part of the world from [www.openstreetmap.org/export](http://www.openstreetmap.org/export) (do not use more than a few square kilometers if you want to be able to run your simulation in real-time) and then save it as a Webots world file (e.g. `myMap.wbt`) using the importer script.

## Dependencies

Follow [these instructions](../guide/using-python.md) to install Python.

Then install the Python `lxml`, `pyproj`, `shapely` and `webcolors` modules, as described below.

### Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install lxml pyproj shapely webcolors configparser
```

### macOS

```
pip install lxml pyproj shapely webcolors configparser --user
```

### Windows

Download the `Shapely` and `pyproj` Python wheels:

- [`Shapely‑<<version>>‑cp<<python_version>>‑cp<<python_version>>m‑win_amd64.whl`](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely)
- [`pyproj‑<<version>>‑cp<<python_version>>‑cp<<python_version>>m‑win_amd64.whl`](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj)

Type in the [Windows Command Prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) open in *Administrator* mode:

```
%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts\pip.exe install lxml
%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts\pip.exe install %HOME%\Downloads\pyproj‑<<version>>‑cp<<python_version>>‑cp<<python_version>>m‑win_amd64.whl
%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts\pip.exe install webcolors
%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts\pip.exe install configparser
%PYTHON_PATH%\Scripts\pip.exe install %HOME%\Downloads\Shapely‑<<version>>‑cp<<python_version>>‑cp<<python_version>>m‑win_amd64.whl
```

## How to Use the Importer

You should use the `importer.py` Python script to generate the `myMap.wbt` webots simulation world from the `myMap.osm` file:

```sh
cd $WEBOTS_HOME/resources/osm_importer
python importer.py --input=myMap.osm --output=myMap.wbt
```

Some extra folders such as `forest` can be generated in the target directory depending on the importer arguments.

Find [here](scenario-creation-tutorial.md) a detailed tutorial about an automobile scenario creation.

## Arguments

You can use several arguments with this script:

## Map Edition and Creation

If you want to edit a map exported from OpenStreetMap before converting it into a Webots world, we recommend using JOSM.
[JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de) is an open source software written in Java.
It is very powerful and easy to use.
Using JOSM you can easily edit a map in order to add some elements, correct some parts, etc.

%figure "Left: the OSM file created in JOSM. Right: the resulting world open in Webots after conversion"

![osm_input.png](images/osm_input.png)
![osm_output.png](images/osm_output.png)

%end

In addition to editing map from OpenStreetmap, JOSM is also very convenient to create new environment from scratch.
You can see in the [previous picture](#left-the-osm-file-created-in-josm-right-the-resulting-world-open-in-webots-after-conversion) a map fully created in JOSM and then exported and opened in Webots.

### Supported OSM Keywords

 Only a subset of the OpenStreetMap keywords are handled by the importer. Here is the list of keywords currently supported for each OpenStreetMap object type:

#### Node

##### Tree

The [natural](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:natural) keyword will result in an isolated tree. The following associated keywords are taken into account:
  - `leaf_type`: the value should be either `needleleaved` or `broadleaved`.
  - `height`.
  - `diameter_crown`.


#### Way

##### Building

The [building](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building) or [building:part](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:part) keyword will result in a 3 dimensional building. The following associated keywords are taken into account:
  - `building:material` or `material`: the value should be either: `wood`, `old house`, `plaster`, `cement_block`, `concrete`, `glass` or `mirror`.
  - `roof:material`: the value should be either: `tile`, `roof_tiles`, `concrete`, `slate`, `asbestos` or `metal`.
  - `building:colour`.
  - `roof:colour`.
  - `name` or `ref`.
  - `roof:height`.
  - `min_height`.
  - `height`.
  - `roof:shape`.
  - `layer`.
  - `building:levels`.
  - `building:min_level`.

##### Road

The [highway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway) keyword will result in a road. The following associated keywords are taken into account:
  - `maxspeed`.
  - `addr:country`: if the `maxspeed` keyword is not defined, the `addr:country` keyword is used to determine the speed limit of the road according to [this conversion table](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Speed_limits#Country_code.2Fcategory_conversion_table).
  - `oneway`: the value should be `yes`.
  - `name`.
  - `lanes`.
  - `layer`.
  - `lanes:forward`.
  - `lanes:backward`.
  - `turn:lanes:forward`.
  - `turn:lanes:backward`.
  - `width`.

##### River

The [waterway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:waterway) keyword will result in a river if its value is `river` or `stream`. The following associated keywords are taken into account:
  - `name`.
  - `width`.

##### Wall and Fence

The [barrier](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:waterway) keyword will result in a wall if its value is `wall` and in a fence if its value is `fence`. The following associated keywords are taken into account:
  - `height`.
  - `width`.

##### Forest

The [natural](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:natural) keyword will result in a forest if its value is `forest`. The following associated keyword is taken into account:
  - `leaf_type`: the value should be either `needleleaved` or `broadleaved`.

##### Parking Lines

If the value of the [name](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) keyword is `parking line` it will result in a parking line.

##### Area

The following keywords will result in a flat area:
  - `amenity`: if the value is `parking`.
  - `landuse`.
  - `waterway`.

#### Relation

The following keywords are taken into account, they work the exact same way as for [way](#way):
  - `building`
  - `natural`
  - `landuse`
  - `parking`

### Configuration File

In addition to the defined keywords, a configuration file can be used to define the default value when a keyword is not defined (e.g. the default height of the buildings or of the buildings of a specific type) or to define which objects should or should not be imported.

It is possible to set default values for all the entities of an object in the section determined by its name (e.g. `building` section for buildings, or `road` section for roads).


It is also possible to set default values for a specific type of object, the name of the section should respect the following syntax: `<<name of the object>>_<<value of the associated keyword>>`. For example:
  - `building_residential` for buildings whose `building` keyword value is `residential`.
  - `road_primary` for roads whose `highway` keyword value is `primary`. In this case the name of the object is `road` and not `highway` because in Webots they are called `road` and not `highway` like in OpenStreetMap.

A typical configuration file is provided in [appendix](a-typical-openstreetmap-importer-configuration-file.md).

## Graphical User Interface

To ease the use of this tool, a graphical interace has been created.
This grapical interface can easily be started from the last tab of the [robot window](robot-window.md).

%figure "The OpenStreetMap importer graphical user interface"

![osm_gui.png](images/osm_gui.png)

%end

As you can see on [previous picture](#the-openstreetmap-importer-graphical-user-interface), it is easy to set all the arguments of the script using the graphical user interface of the robot window.
Furthermore, using this graphical interface you can choose either to give an osm file as input or a map area using a latitude-longitude rectangle.
If you choose to use a latitude-longitude rectangle, it will take care to automatically download the corresponding osm file before launching the script (you will therefore require an internet connexion).
