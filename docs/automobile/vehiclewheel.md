## VehicleWheel

The `VehicleWheel` allows the user to easily create vehicle wheels.
It is designed to be generic and customizable to cover a wide range of wheel configurations.
The base node of the `VehicleWheel` PROTO is a [Slot](../reference/slot.md) of type `vehicle wheel` so that it can only be inserted as a wheel of a vehicle PROTO featuring the corresponding `vehicleWheel` slots.

### VehicleWheel Field Summary

- `name`: Identifies the wheel.
- `thickness`: Defines the thickness of the wheel.
- `tireRadius`: Defines the outer radius of the wheel.
- `subdivision`: Defines the number of subdivisions for the cylinder approximation.
- `curvatureFactor`: Defines the curvature of the wheel, should be between 0 and 1.
- `edgeSubdivision`: Defines the number of subdivisions for the edge approximation.
- `rimRadius`: Defines the radius of the separation between the rim and the tire.
- `rimBeamNumber`: Defines the number of beams of the wheel.
- `rimBeamWidth`: Defines the width of the beams.
- `centralInnerRadius and centralOuterRadius`: Defines the geometry of the central part of the wheel.
- `rimBeamThickness`: Defines the lateral thickness of the beams.
- `rimBeamOffset`: Defines the lateral offset of the beams.
- `contactMaterial`: Defines the `contactMaterial` used for the wheel.
- `tireAppearance`: Specifies the appearance of the tire.
- `rimAppearance`: Specifies the appearance of the rim.
- `physics`: `Physics` node of the wheel defining all the physical characteristics.
- `logoSlot`: extension slot allowing the user to add a [Shape](../reference/shape.md) node for a brand logo.

Some sample instances of wheels are provided (see for example `BmwX5Wheel.proto`) which inherit from `VehicleWheel`.
