## Nodes and Functions

### Nodes

Webots nodes listed in this reference are described using standard VRML97 syntax.
Principally, Webots uses a subset of the VRML97 nodes and fields, but it also defines additional nodes and fields specific to robotic definitions.
For example, the Webots [WorldInfo](worldinfo.md) and [Sphere](sphere.md) nodes have additional fields with respect to VRML97.

### Functions

This manual covers all the functions of the controller API, necessary to program robots.
The C prototypes of these functions are described under the *SYNOPSIS* tag.
The prototypes for the other languages are available through hyperlinks or directly in [this chapter](other-apis.md).
The language-related particularities mentioned under the label called *C++ Note, Java Note, Python Note, MATLAB Note*, etc.
