## TextureTransform

```
TextureTransform {
  SFVec2f center      0 0   # any vector
  SFFloat rotation    0     # (-inf, inf)
  SFVec2f scale       1 1   # any vector
  SFVec2f translation 0 0   # any vector
}
```

The [TextureTransform](#texturetransform) node defines a 2D transformation that is applied to texture coordinates.
This node affects the way textures are applied to the surface of a `Geometry`.
The transformation consists of (in order):

- a translation;
- a rotation about the center point;
- a non-uniform scaling operation about the center point.

These parameters support changes in the size, orientation, and position of textures on shapes.
Note that these operations appear reversed when viewed on the surface of a geometric node.
For example, a `scale` value of (2 2) will scale the texture coordinates, with the net effect of shrinking the texture size by a factor of 2 (texture coordinates are twice as large and thus cause the texture to repeat).
A `translation` of (0.5 0.0) translates the texture coordinates +0.5 units along the *s* axis, with the net effect of translating the texture -0.5 along the *s* axis on the geometry's surface.
A `rotation` of &pi;/2 of the texture coordinates results in a -&pi;/2 rotation of the texture on the geometric node.

The `center` field specifies a translation offset in texture coordinate space about which the `rotation` and `scale` fields are applied.
The `scale` field specifies a scaling factor in *s* and *t* of the texture coordinates about the center point.
The `rotation` field specifies a rotation in radians of the texture coordinates about the center point after the scaling operation has been applied.
A positive rotation value makes the texture coordinates rotate counterclockwise about the center, thereby rotating the appearance of the texture clockwise.
The `translation` field specifies a translation of the texture coordinates.

Given a point **T** with texture coordinates *(s,t)* and a [TextureTransform](#texturetransform) node, **T** is transformed into the point **T'***=(s',t')* by the three intermediate transformations described above.
Let *C* be the translation mapping *(0,0)* to the point *(C<sub>s</sub><sub>t</sub>*, *T* be the translation of vector *(T<sub>s</sub><sub>t</sub>*, *R* the rotation with center *(0,0)* and angle Î¸ , and *S* a scaling with scaling factors *S<sub>s</sub><sub>t</sub>*.
In matrix notation, the corresponding `TextureTransform` reads as:

*C<sup>-1</sup>* denotes the matrix inverse of *C*.

Note that [TextureTransform](#texturetransform) nodes cannot combine or accumulate.
