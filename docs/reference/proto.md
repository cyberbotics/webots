# PROTO

The PROTO mechanism allows users to extend the set of nodes by adding their own nodes.
Thus, users can build and reuse complex objects.

A PROTO defines a new node type in terms of built-in nodes or other PROTO nodes.
The PROTO interface defines the fields for the PROTO.
Once defined, PROTO nodes may be instantiated in the scene tree exactly like built-in nodes.

The tutorial entitled [Your First PROTO](../guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto.md) provides a hands-on procedure to create your own PROTO node.
