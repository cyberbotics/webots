## Webots 6.0.beta1
Released on November 14th, 2008 (revision 2318).

  - Important modifications C API:
    - The `wb_` prefix was added to every function names, e.g. `robot_get_device()` becomes `wb_robot_get_device()`, etc.
    - The `Wb` prefix was added to every type name, e.g. DeviceTag is renamed WbDeviceTag, NodeRef is renamed WbNodeRef, etc.
    - The `WB_` prefix was added to every constant, e.g. `SERVO_INFINITY` becomes `WB_SERVO_INFINITY`, etc.
    - All includes were changed, e.g. #include <device/robot.h> now becomes #include <webots/robot.h>
    - The functions `robot_live()`, `robot_run()` and `robot_die()` are deprecated, they are now replaced by `wb_robot_init()` and `wb_robot_cleanup()`
  - Important modifications of the JAVA API:
    - A new SWIG-generated and object-oriented Java API replaces the previous flat Java API in Controller.java
  - Important modifications of the C++ and Python API:
    - Modified the classes hierarchy
  - General modifications of the API for all languages:
    - The `robot_console_print()` method is deprecated, it can be replaced by the language specific print methods
    - All floating point parameters and return values were changed from type `float` to type `double`
    - Added a new collection of Supervisor functions for setting and getting any field value in the scene tree
    - Added a new collection of functions for playing motion files
    - Deprecated `custom_robot_move()`, `custom_robot_set_rel_force_and_torque()` and `custom_robot_set_abs_force_and_torque()` functions, the physics plugin should be used in replacement
    - The function emitter_send_packet() was renamed `wb_emitter_send()`
    - Deprecated `gps_get_matrix()` and `gps_euler()` functions, the `wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_rotation()` should be used as replacement
    - Definitely removed all previously deprecated functions: `servo_motor_off()`, `servo_get_feedback()`, `emitter_get_buffer()`, `receiver_get_buffer()`, `receiver_get_buffer_size()`
  - Fixed: View/Rendering/Bounding Objects menus now correctly switches to bounding objects rendering instead of wireframe
  - Fixed: bounding objects rendered at wrong location (but computed at correct location) when Physics.centerOfMass is non-null
  - Renamed the `CustomRobot` node into `Robot`: existing .wbt files will be automatically and silently updated when they are opened
  - Changes two rules for all `lookupTables` fields:
    - The second column of all `lookupTable` fields are now interpreted as double (instead of unsigned short int) values. Therefore all sensors using `lookupTable` fields (DistanceSensor, LightSensor, TouchSensor, etc.) do now also return doubles in the corresponding `...\_get_value()` functions
    - In addition, an emtpy lookupTable ([ ]), now returns non-interpolated sensor values
  - Rearranged the Webots windows into a single big window (using the wxWidgets AUI system)
