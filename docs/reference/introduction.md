# Introduction

This manual contains the specification of the nodes and fields of the ".wbt" world description language used in Webots.
It also specifies the functions available to operate on these nodes from controller programs.

The Webots nodes and APIs are open specifications which can be freely reused without authorization from Cyberbotics.
The Webots API can be freely ported and adapted to operate on any robotics platform using the remote-control and/or the cross-compilation frameworks.
Cyberbotics offers support to help developers implementing the Webots API on real robots.
This benefits to the robotics community by improving interoperability between different robotics applications.
