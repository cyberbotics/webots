    - **Deprecated all the device getter methods in Python.** They are replaced by a new [`Robot.getDevice`](robot.md#wb_robot_get_device) method which is closer to the C API ([#2510](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2510)).
    - **Fixed reversed pixel bytes order for [Display](display.md) images loaded with [`wb_display_image_new`](display.md#wb_display_image_new)** ([#2452](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2452)).
    - Fixed the [webots\_physics\_collide(dGeomID, dGeomID)](callback-functions.md) callback function so that it gets called even if the [`boundingObject`](solid.md#field-summary) is a [Group](group.md) node ([#2505](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2505)).
  - Cleanup
    - **Deleted `run` mode as the same behavior now can be achieved by using `fast` mode while keeping the rendering turned on ([#2286](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2286)).**
    - **Changed ROS message type published by the [GPS](gps.md) node when it is configured to work in `local` GPS coordinate system ([#2368](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2368))**.
    - Fixed updating the robot's device list after importing a device node at run time in a field descending from a joint ([#2482](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2482)).
  - Dependency Updates
    - Upgraded to Qt 5.15.1 on Windows ([#2312](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2312)).
    - **Stopped releasing Webots packages compatible with Ubuntu 16.04.** To run Webots on Ubuntu 16.04, please [compile from sources](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation) ([#2473](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2473)).
    - Updated the Thymio II Aseba controller to Aseba 1.3.3 ([#2518](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/2518)).
