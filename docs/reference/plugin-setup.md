## Plugin Setup

You can add a new plugin, or edit the existing plugin, by using the menu `Tools / Edit Physics Plugin`.
After a physics plugin was created it must be associated with the current ".wbt" file.
This can be done in the Scene Tree: the [WorldInfo](worldinfo.md) node has a field called `physics` which indicates the name of the physics plugin associated with the current world.
Select the `WorldInfo.physics` field, then hit the `Select...` button.
A dialog pops-up and lets you choose one of the plugins available in the current project.
Choose a plugin in the dialog and then save the ".wbt" file.

Note that the `WorldInfo.physics` string specifies the name of the plugin source and binary files without extension.
The extension will be added by Webots depending on the platform: it will be ".so" (Linux), ".dll" (Windows) or ".dylib" (macOS) for the binary file.
For example, this [WorldInfo](worldinfo.md) node:

```
WorldInfo {
  ...
  physics "my_physics"
  ...
}
```

This specifies that the plugin binary file is expected to be at the location "my\_project/plugins/physics/my\_physics/my\_physics[.dll|.dylib|.so]" (actual extension depending on the platform) and that the plugin source file should be located in "my\_project/plugins/physics/my\_physics/my\_physics[.c|.cpp]".
If Webots does not find the file there, it will also look in the "[WEBOTS\_HOME/resources/projects/plugins/physics]({{ url.github_tree }}/resources/projects/plugins/physics)" directory.
