## ODE: Open Dynamics Engine

Webots relies on ODE, the Open Dynamics Engine, for physics simulation.
Hence, some Webots parameters, structures or concepts refer to ODE.
The Webots documentation does not, however, duplicate or replace the ODE documentation.
Hence, it is recommended to consult the ODE documentation to understand these parameters, structures or concepts.
This ODE documentation is available online from the [ODE web site](http://www.ode.org).
