## Group

```
Group {
  MFNode children [ ]    # {node, PROTO}
}
```

Direct derived nodes: [Transform](transform.md), [Billboard](billboard.md).

A [Group](#group) node contains `children` nodes without introducing a new transformation.
It is equivalent to a [Transform](transform.md) node containing an identity transform.
