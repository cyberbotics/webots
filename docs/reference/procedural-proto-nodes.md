## Procedural PROTO Nodes

The expressive power of PROTO nodes can be significantly improved by extending them using a scripting language.
In this way, the PROTO node may contain constants, mathematic expressions, loops, conditional expressions, randomness, and so on.

### Scripting Language

Procedural PROTO nodes can be scripted either in [Lua](http://www.lua.org) or in JavaScript.
In the future, [Lua](http://www.lua.org) support will be discontinued therefore JavaScript should be preferred if possible.
