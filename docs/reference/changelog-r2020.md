## [Webots R2020a](../blog/Webots-2020-a-release.md)
Released on December 18th, 2019.

  - New Robots
    - Added several TIAGo robots from PAL Robotics: TIAGo Base, TIAGo Iron, TIAGo Steel, TIAGo Titanium and TIAGopp.
    - Added a model of the Robotino 3 from [Festo](https://www.festo-didactic.com/int-en/).
    - Added a model of the TurtleBot3 Burger from [Robotis](http://www.robotis.us/) and its `LDS-01` lidar sensor.
  - New Samples
    - Added a `complete_apartment` world.
  - New Features
    - Improved the [Background](background.md) node:
      - Added the `Background.luminosity` field which specifies the light contribution of the [Background](background.md) node. Open this field in the `TexturedBackground` and the `TexturedBackgroundLight` PROTO nodes.
      - Dropped the support of the equirectangular projection in textures to improve loading time.
      - Dropped the `Cubemap` node to improve consistency.
      - Deprecated non-HDR backgrounds.
      - Restored the `Background.*Url` fields, and support only `JPEG` and `PNG` format there.
      - Introduced the `Background.*IrradianceUrl` fields to define an `HDR` irradiance map.
      - Added image tools to help with `HDR` format and equirectangular projections.
      - Added new HDR background: `entrance_hall`
    - Added several new appearances: `Copper`, `CorrugatedPlates`, `CorrugatedPvc`, `DryMud`, `FormedConcrete`,  `Pcb`, `RoughPolymer` and `TireRubber`.
    - Replaced the [Viewpoint](viewpoint.md) `followOrientation` field by a `followType` field for more flexibility.
    - Added new functions to add force and torque to [Solid](solid.md) nodes: `wb_supervisor_node_add_force`, `wb_supervisor_node_add_force_with_offset` and `wb_supervisor_node_add_torque`.
    - Added function to import and remove nodes from SFNode fields: `wb_supervisor_field_remove_sf`, `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node` and `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node_from_string`.
    - Improved the Webots online 3D viewer: `webots.min.js`
      - Improved support of the Webots rendering pipeline: supported the Bloom post-processing effect.
      - Added support for the `ImageTexture.filtering` field.
      - Improved the console log history. Added a button to clear the console.
    - Improved [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net) worlds.
      - Improved overall graphics quality (using the PBR materials and the HDR backgrounds).
      - Improved `humanoid_sprint` benchmark metrics.
    - Added a [script to cleanup the Webots preferences](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/scripts/preferences_cleaner/README.md).
    - Linux: Added support for Python 3.8.
  - Enhancements
    - **Updated argument type in the [`wb_robot_set_mode()`](robot.md#wb_robot_set_mode) function from `void *` to `const char *`.**
    - **Renamed the `physics` field of the `MultiSenseS21` and `SickLdMrs` PROTO nodes into `enablePhysics`.**
    - Improved the Sick LD MRS PROTO to support the following types: `400001`, `400102`, `400001S01`, `400102S01` and `800001S01`.
    - **Improved the [`wb_supervisor_simulation_reset`](supervisor.md#wb_supervisor_simulation_reset) to avoid restarting the controllers, if needed the controllers can be restarted with [`wb_supervisor_node_restart_controller`](supervisor.md#wb_supervisor_node_restart_controller).**
    - Set the ABB IRB 4600/40 PROTO root node to [Robot](robot.md) instead of [Solid](solid.md) to be able to insert it everywhere.
    - Webots now waits for extern controllers if the `Robot.synchronization` field is set to `TRUE`.
    - Device names are displayed in the scene tree next to the node name.
    - Split the Webots and controller libraries to avoid possible conflicts with external libraries.
    - Windows/Linux: Move the `Check for updates...` menu from `Tools` to `Help` for consistency with other applications.

    - Fixed [Lidar](lidar.md) point cloud access in controllers (thanks to Alexander).
    - Fixed bugs in Python Display.imageNew() when passing an image array: rearranged image data from column-major order and memory leak (thanks to Inbae Jeong).

    - Fixed missing `WB_NODE_NORMAL` node type in MATLAB API.
    - Fixed arguments of `wb_supervisor_node_get_number_of_contacts_points()` function in MATLAB API.
