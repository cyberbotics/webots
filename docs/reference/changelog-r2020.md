    - Added a `complete_apartment` world.
  - New Features
    - Improved the [Background](background.md) node:
      - Added the `Background.luminosity` field which specifies the light contribution of the [Background](background.md) node. Open this field in the `TexturedBackground` and the `TexturedBackgroundLight` PROTO nodes.
      - Dropped the support of the equirectangular projection in textures to improve loading time.
      - Dropped the `Cubemap` node to improve consistency.
      - Deprecated non-HDR backgrounds.
      - Restored the `Background.*Url` fields, and support only `JPEG` and `PNG` format there.
      - Introduced the `Background.*IrradianceUrl` fields to define an `HDR` irradiance map.
      - Added image tools to help with `HDR` format and equirectangular projections.
      - Added new HDR background: `entrance_hall`
    - Added several new appearances: `Copper`, `CorrugatedPlates`, `CorrugatedPvc`, `DryMud`, `FormedConcrete`,  `Pcb`, `RoughPolymer` and `TireRubber`.
    - Replaced the [Viewpoint](viewpoint.md) `followOrientation` field by a `followType` field for more flexibility.

    - Set the [ABB IRB 4600/40](../guide/irb4600-40.md) root node to [Robot](robot.md) instead of [Solid](solid.md) to be able to insert it everywhere.
    - Webots now waits for extern controllers if the `Robot.synchronization` field is set to `TRUE`.
    - Device names are displayed in the scene tree next to the node name.
