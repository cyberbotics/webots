# CMakeLists.txt for the 'resources' directory

# Add subdirectories. Each of these will require its own CMakeLists.txt
# to define how its contents are built/processed and installed.
add_subdirectory(translations)
add_subdirectory(projects) # This is resources/projects

# Other files and directories in 'resources' (like fonts, icons, images, templates, etc.)
# are typically handled by 'install(DIRECTORY ...)' commands in the root CMakeLists.txt
# or directly here if specific processing is needed before installation.
# The existing root CMakeLists.txt already has:
# install(DIRECTORY resources/ DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/webots/resources ...)
# This will cover most static assets. If specific files from 'resources' need to be
# generated or processed by CMake, that logic would go here or in specific subdirectory CMakeLists.txt files.

# The Makefile targets (release, debug, profile, clean, cleanse)
# are generally handled by CMake's built-in build type configurations (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE)
# and the standard 'clean' target generated by CMake.
# Specific cleaning tasks like 'rm -rf sumo_exporter/*.pyc' would need
# to be translated into custom clean commands or handled by the build process of 'sumo_exporter' if it gets its own CMakeLists.txt.
