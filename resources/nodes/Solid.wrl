# A Solid node can be used to represent objects in the simulated environment (e.g. obstacles, walls, ground, robot parts, etc.).
# Solid nodes can be collision detected (boundingObject) and therefore can prevent objects from intersecting.
# In addition, Solid nodes can have an optional Physics node that allow them to be simulated with the physics engine.
