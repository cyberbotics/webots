# A TouchSensor can be used to measure contact force ("force", "force-3d") or simply detect collisions ("bumper").
# It is critical that 'boundingObject' of a TouchSensor is defined and placed appropriately.
# Refer to the Webots reference manual for more information on this.

TouchSensor { #models a bumper, button, cat whisker, force sensor etc.
