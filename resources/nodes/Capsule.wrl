# A Capsule is like a normal cylinder except it has half-sphere caps at its ends.
# This primitive features particularly fast and accurate collision detection.
# The cylinder's height, not counting the caps, is given by the height field.
# The Capsule is aligned along the local z-axis.
# The radius of the caps and of the cylinder itself is given by the radius field.
