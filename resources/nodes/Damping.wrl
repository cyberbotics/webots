# A Damping node can be used to add linear and rotational damping to a Solid node.
# The damping will slow down the motion of Solid nodes and allow them to come to rest.

Damping {
  field SFFloat linear           0.2   # linear damping coefficient
  field SFFloat angular          0.2   # angular damping coefficient
