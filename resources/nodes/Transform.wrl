# The Transform node is a grouping node that defines a coordinate system for its children that is
# relative to the coordinate system of its parent.
# The 'scale' field of a Transform node can be adjusted only in a graphical context and not in a 'boundingObject' context.

  #fields specific to the AbstractTransform node:
