# A Physics node allows to specify the physical properties (density, mass, friction coefficient, etc.) of the solid object that contains it.
# When a Physics node is added to a solid object, this indicates that the dynamics (forces, gravity, friction, inertia, etc.) of the object
# must be simulated, otherwise only the kinematics is simulated.
