# A Plane node defines an infinite 3D plane at y=0 in the local coordinate system.
# The Plane can be used in a boundingObject to simulate boundaries, e.g., the floor or infinite walls.
# The size field is used only for the visual representation, when collision detection is concerned the Plane is infinite.
# The Plane is a strictly static object, it cannot be placed in the boundingObject of a dynamic (Physics-based) object.
