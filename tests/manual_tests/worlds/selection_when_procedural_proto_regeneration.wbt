    "Aim:"
    "- To test that the scene tree and 3D view selection remain coherent after a procedural "
    "  PROTO regeneration (either fired from a supervisor or from the GUI)."
    ""
    "What is occurring:"
    "- The Supervisor fires the SolidBox regeneration after 10 steps."
    ""
    "Test procedure:"
    "- Whatever is selected in the scene tree or in the 3D view, this selection remains unchanged after step 10."
    "- At step 0, the selection remains:"
    "    - when editing SolidBox.size from the scene tree."
    "    - when editing Top.my_parameter.my_custom_parameter from the scene tree."
